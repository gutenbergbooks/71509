<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> sustentation of the body, and the repairing of its
waste by an adequate supply of wholesome and nutritious
daily food, is a subject of general importance, and
necessarily occupies a large share of attention. But
all nations have not the advantages of skilful cattle-breeders,
slaughter-houses, well-supplied meat and
poultry markets, and butchers’ shops graced with all
the tempting joints of beef, mutton, and pork, which
gladden the eyes of an Englishman, and keep up his
stamina for labour. The traveller, the settler, and the
savage, must be content to put up with what they can
most readily obtain, and to avail themselves of many
an unusual article of food, which would be rejected
under more favourable circumstances, and with a greater
choice for selection.</p>

<p>The subject of Food, in a physiological point of view,
has been often discussed. Popular and learned treatises
on all the art and mysteries of Cookery have been sold
by thousands. We have had pleasant details furnished
us too on the Food and the Commissariat of London.—But
with respect to the animal substances, eaten by other
people in foreign countries, we have known little—except
from mere scraps of information.</p>

<p>The basis of the present volume is a lecture on the
Curiosities of Food, which I delivered at several of the
metropolitan literary institutions. Having been favourably
received,—from the novelty of the subject, and the
singularity of the specimens from my private museum
by which it was illustrated,—I have been led to believe
that it might prove generally interesting in a more amplified
shape.</p>

<p>In order, however, to bring the details within a convenient
compass, I have limited myself to a description
of the Curiosities of Animal Food; but should the
work be well received, I may follow it up hereafter by
a companion volume, on the Curiosities of Vegetable
Food.</p>

<p>In the arrangement of the materials for this work,
one of two modes of description was open to me,
either to dress up the details in characteristic pictures
of the food-customs and viands in use in different
quarters, and by different people; or to group the
whole scientifically under natural history divisions.
As the subject is curious and striking enough in its
simplicity without the aid of fiction or embellishment,
I have preferred adopting the latter arrangement, and
have followed it as closely as the miscellaneous character
of the selections and quotations would permit.</p>

<p>Many of the articles of food named are so outrageously
repulsive, and the consideration of the subject,
in a collected form, is altogether so new, that I have
preferred citing authorities in all instances, so as to
relieve myself from the charge of exaggeration, or the
imputation of untenable assertions. For this reason,
and from the varied and very extended nature of the
field of enquiry, I can claim no merit for original
writing in this work. I have merely desired to present
the public with a readable volume; and I think its
perusal will show that in this, as in other cases, truth
is often stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>After a perusal of these pages, it can scarcely be
said that, ‘there is nothing new under the sun,’ for
many of the articles of food which I have described as
being served up in different parts of the world, will be
certainly new to many. Probably, some of the hints
thrown out will make the fortune of any restaurateur
in the city or at the west-end, who chooses to dish up
one or more of the reputed delicacies, under a proper
disguise, and with a high-sounding name.</p>

</div>

<p class="c up sp">CURIOSITIES OF FOOD.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">What</span> is the prevailing food of the people? Is it
chiefly animal or vegetable, and whence is it derived in
the two kingdoms? Do they trust to what the bounty
of Nature provides, or have they the means of modifying
or controlling production, whether in the cultivation
of vegetables, or the rearing of animals? Describe
their modes of cooking, and state the kinds of condiments
they employ. Have they in use any kind of
fermented liquor? What number of meals do they
make, and what is their capacity for temporary or sustained
exertion?</p>

<p>These are some of the enquiries to which a traveller
is directed to pay attention, if he wishes to furnish
and diffuse useful information.</p>

<p>I do not intend to go over this wide field of investigation
in the systematic and scientific manner shadowed
forth by these enquiries, but merely desire to assist the
reader to pass a leisure hour, although he may probably
glean some useful information at the same time.</p>

<p>I propose bringing under notice some of the Animal
food in which people in various countries indulge, not
that I wish persons to test these meats, or to live upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
them, unless they please. I do not deal in them, and have
no interest in their collection or sale, but I merely desire
to introduce them to notice that the reader may ascertain
the opinions entertained of them, think over them,
and know how much better an Englishman is fed than
any one else in the world. So that, despite our habit
of grumbling, there is at least this undeniable fact before
us, that the middle classes are in very easy circumstances;
and that English workmen earn good wages, or they
could not consume the quantity of animal food they do
at the present prices.</p>

<p>According to Vauban, Bossuet, and La Grange, the
richest and most comfortable nation is that which eats
the most meat. At the present prices of this article
here, it certainly must be so, for a poor nation could
not indulge in the luxury.</p>

<p>Beef and mutton, and mutton and beef, no matter
what their price, John Bull will not dispense with; and
although they are 40 or 50 per cent. dearer now than
they were ten years ago, and although we import animals
largely from abroad, and our cattle-breeders do their
best to meet the demand, cattle and sheep will not increase
and multiply fast enough to bring down the
price for the consumer.</p>

<p>A writer in <i>Household Words</i> thus alludes to our
national weakness.—‘Next to the Habeas Corpus and the
Freedom of the Press, there are few things that the English
people have a greater respect for and a livelier faith
in than beef. They bear, year after year, with the same
interminable, unvarying series of woodcuts of fat oxen
in the columns of the illustrated newspapers; they are
never tired of crowding to the Smithfield Club cattle-show;
and I am inclined to think that it is their honest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
reverence for beef that has induced them to support so
long the obstruction and endangerment of the thoroughfares
of the metropolis by oxen driven to slaughter.
Beef is a great connecting link and bond of better
feeling between the great classes of the commonwealth.
Do not Dukes hob and nob with top-booted farmers
over the respective merits of short-horns and Alderneys?
Does not the noble Marquis of Argentfork give an ox to
be roasted whole on the village green when his son, the
noble Viscount Silvercoral, comes of age? Beef makes
boys into men. Beef nerves our navvies. The bowmen
who won Cressy and Agincourt were beef-fed, and had
there been more and better beef in the Crimea a year or
two ago, our soldiers would have borne up better under
the horrors of a Chersonesean winter. We feast on beef
at the great Christian festival. A baron of beef at the
same time is enthroned in St. George’s Hall, in Windsor’s
ancient castle, and is borne in by lacqueys in
scarlet and gold. Charles the Second knighted a loin
of beef, and I have a shrewd suspicion that the famous
Sir Bevis of Southampton was but an ardent admirer
and doughty knight-errant in the cause of beef. And
who does not know the tradition that even as the first
words of the new-born Gargantua were ‘A boyre, à
boyre,’ signifying that he desired a draught of Burgundy
wine—so the first intelligible sounds that the
infant Guy of Warwick ever spake were ‘Beef, beef!’
When the weary pilgrim reaches the beloved shores of
England after a long absence, what first does he remark—after
the incivility of the custom-house officers—but
the great tankard of stout and the noble round of cold
beef in the coffee-room of the hotel? He does not cry
‘Io Bacche! Evöe Bacche!’ because beef is not Bacchus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
He does not fall down and kiss his native soil,
because the hotel carpet is somewhat dusty, and the
action would be, besides, egregious; but he looks at the
beef, and his eyes filling with tears, a corresponding
humidity takes place in his mouth; he kisses the beef;
he is so fond of it that he could eat it all up; and he
does ordinarily devour so much of it to his breakfast,
that the thoughtful waiter gazes at him, and murmurs
to his napkin, ‘This man is either a cannibal or a pilgrim
grey who has not seen Albion for many years.’</p>

<p>It has been well observed, that there are few things in
which the public have so great and general an interest,
and concerning which they possess so little real knowledge,
as of the provision trade and the wholesale traffic
in animals live and dead, in their own and other
countries. When, where, and how raised, and what
processes meat passes through before it reaches their
tables, are questions which, though highly important,
are very seldom asked by the consumers—all that they
usually trouble themselves with is, the current retail
price, and the nature of the supply.</p>

<p>Few of us think as we sit down to our rump steak
or pork chop, our sirloin or leg of mutton, of the awful
havoc of quadrupeds necessary to furnish the daily
meals of the millions. I will not weary the reader with
statistics, although I have a long array of figures before
me, bearing upon the slaughter of animals for food
in different countries. It will be sufficient to generalize.</p>

<p>If the hecatomb of animals we have each consumed
in the years we have lived, were marshalled in array
before us, we should stand aghast at the possibility of
our ever having devoured the quantity of animal food,
and sacrificed for our daily meals the goodly number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
well-fed quadrupeds of the ovine, bovine, and porcine
races, or the fish, fowl, reptiles, and insects, which would
be thus re-embodied.</p>

<p>The average quantity of animal food of all kinds
consumed in France is stated on good authority—that of
M. Payen—to be as low as one-sixth of a pound per
diem to each person. Even in the cities and large
towns, especially Paris, the amount of food upon which
a Frenchman lives is astonishingly small. An Englishman
or an American would starve upon such fare.</p>

<p>In proportion to its population, New York consumes
as nearly as possible the same quantity of meat as
London, about half-a-pound a day to each person; more
beef, however, is consumed there and less mutton, and
the latter fact may be accounted for by the comparative
inferiority of quality.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice the various parts of animals
that are eaten, or selected as choice morsels by different
persons or classes. Sheep’s head, pig’s head, calf’s
head and brains, ox head, the heads of ducks and geese,
ox tongue, reindeer tongue, walrus tongue, crane’s
tongue, &amp;c. Fowls and ducks’ tongues are esteemed an
exquisite Chinese dainty. The pettitoes of the sucking
pig, or the mature feet and hocks of the elder hog,
sheep’s trotters, calf’s feet, cow heel, bear’s paws, elephant’s
feet, the feet of ducks and geese, and their giblets;
ox tail, pig’s tail, sheep’s tail, kangaroo tail, beaver’s
tail. And the entrails again are not despised, whether
it be bullock’s heart or sheep’s heart, liver and lights,
lamb’s fry or pig’s fry, tripe and chitterlings, goose
liver and gizzard, the cleaned gut for our sausages, the
fish maws, cod liver, and so on. The moufle, or loose
covering of the nose, of the great moose deer or elk is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
considered by New Brunswick epicures a great dainty.
The hump of the buffalo, the trunk of the elephant, are
other delicacies. Deer’s sinews, and the muscle of the
ox, the buffalo, and the wild hog, jerked or dried in
the sun, and then termed, ‘dendeng,’ is a delicacy of
the Chinese, imported at a high price from Siam and the
eastern islands.</p>

<p>The eggs of different animals, again, form choice
articles of food, whether they be those of the ordinary
domestic poultry, the eggs of sea fowl, of the plover,
and of game birds, of the ostrich and emu, of the tortoises
and other reptilia, as alligator’s eggs, snake’s
eggs, and those of the iguana, or the eggs of insects, and
of fishes.</p>

<p>Amid all the multiplicity of special dainties, appreciated
by different peoples, the prejudices of the stomach
are, perhaps, more unconquerable than any other that
tyrannize over the human mind. It is almost impossible
to get people to adventure, or experimentalize
upon a <i>new</i> kind of food. There is a great want of
courage and enterprise on this head among Englishmen.
John Bull is resolved to eat, drink, and do only
what he has been accustomed to. He wants none of your
foreign kickshaws, frogs, and snails in fricassées, or sea
slug, or bird’s nest soup, or horse flesh steak. It is true
he has gradually adventured upon, and now appreciates,
a few select foreign delicacies. Real lively turtle
and caviar, reindeer tongue, an imitation Indian curry,
and such like, have become luxuries; and, probably,
under the mysterious manipulations of Gunter, Soyer,
and other distinguished <i>chefs de cuisine</i>, some other foreign
delicacies have found, or may yet find, their way
upon English tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>They will probably displace ere long the four
standard Scotch dishes, a haggis, a sheep’s head, tripe,
and black puddings, or the common dishes of the Devonshire
peasant and Cornish fisherman, parsley and
squab pies, in which fish, apples, onions, and pork are
incongruously blended.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth and her ladies breakfasted on meat,
bread, and strong ale. Our modern ladies take tea or
coffee, and thin slices of toast or bread. The Esquimaux
drink train oil, and the Cossacks koumis, an ardent
spirit made from mares’ milk. The inhabitants of
France and Germany eat much more largely than we
do of vegetable diet; and drink, at all times of the day,
their acid wines. In Devonshire and Herefordshire,
cyder is the common beverage, and in the Highlands
of Scotland, oatmeal porridge is, in a great measure,
the food, and whiskey the drink of the inhabitants.
The Irish peasant lives, or used to do, chiefly on potatoes,
and most of the Hindoos of the maritime provinces
on rice.</p>

<p>Yet all this variety, and much more, is digested,
yields nutriment, and promotes growth; affording undeniable
evidence that man is really omnivorous, that
he can be supported by great varieties of food.</p>

<p>A recent writer speaking of human diet says, ‘it is a
remarkable circumstance, that man alone is provided
with a case of instruments adapted to the mastication of
all substances,—teeth to cut, and pierce, and champ,
and grind; a gastric solvent too, capable of contending
with any thing and every thing, raw substances and
cooked, ripe and rotten,—nothing comes amiss to him.’</p>

<p>If animals could speak, as Æsop and other fabulists
make them seem to do, they would declare man to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the most voracious animal in existence. There is
scarcely any living thing that flies in the air, swims in
the sea, or moves on the land, that is not made to
minister to his appetite in some region or other.</p>

<p>Other creatures are, generally, restricted to one sort
of provender at most. They are carnivorous or graminivorous,
piscivorous, or something ivorous; but man is the
universal eater. He pounces with the tiger upon the kid,
with the hawk upon the dove, with the cormorant upon
the herring, and with the small bird upon the insect
and grub. He goes halves with the bee in the honey
cell, but turns upon his partner and cheats him out of
his share of the produce. He grubs up the root with
the sow, devours the fruit with the earwig, and demolishes
the leaves with the caterpillar; for all these several
parts of different vegetables furnish him with food.</p>

<p>Life itself will not hinder his appetite, nor decay
nauseate his palate; for he will as soon devour a lively
young oyster as demolish the fungous produce of a
humid field. This propensity is, indeed, easily abused.
Viands of such incongruous nature and heterogeneous
substance, are sometimes collected, as to make an outrageous
amalgamation, so that an alderman at a city
feast might make one shudder; but this is too curious
an investigation, it is the abuse of abundance too, and
we know that abuse is the origin of all evil. The fact
should lead us to another point of appreciation of goodness
and beneficence. The adaptation of external nature
to man has often been insisted on; the adaptation
of man to all circumstances, states, and conditions, is
carrying out the idea. The inferior animals are tied
down, even by the narrowness of their animal necessities,
to a small range of existence; but man can seldom be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
placed in any circumstance in which his universal appetite
cannot be appeased. From the naked savage
snatching a berry from the thorn, to the well-clad, highly
civilized denizen of the court, surrounded by every
comfort, every luxury; from the tired traveller, who
opens his wallet and produces his oaten cake beside the
welling lymph which is to slake his thirst, to the pursy
justice, ‘in fair round belly with capon lined,’ who
spreads the damask napkin on his knees, tucks his toes
under the table, and revels in calapash and calapee,—what
an infinite diversity of circumstances!</p>

<p>Man, with all his natural and artificial necessities, all
his social and domestic dependencies,—more dependent,
indeed, upon his fellows than the fowls of the air,
from the grand exuberance of nature, and his remarkable
adaptation to it in the point alluded to, finds subsistence
under circumstances in which other animals
might starve.</p>

<p>Perhaps we might properly urge the advice of a
recent writer.—‘Make use of every material possible
for food, remembering that there are chemical
affinities and properties by which nutriment may be extracted
from almost every organic substance, the greatest
art being in proper cooking. Make soup of every kind
of flesh, fish, and leguminosæ.—Every thing adds to its
strength and flavour.’</p>

<p>Man eats to satisfy his hunger, and to supply warmth
to the body; but the lover of good things, who finds a
pleasure in eating, may also be told that there is a
beautiful structure of nerve work spread out on the
tongue, which carries upwards to the brain messages
from the nice things in the mouth.</p>

<p>Moderation in food is, however, one of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
essentials to health. Sydney Smith, in a letter to Lord
Murray, tells him that, having ascertained the weight
of food that he could live upon, so as to preserve health
and strength, and what he had lived upon, he found
that between ten and seventy years of age, he had eaten
and drunk forty-four one-horse wagon loads of meat and
drink more than would have preserved him in life and
health, and that the value of this mass of nourishment
was about £7,000.</p>

<p>Sir John Ross tells us that an Esquimaux will eat
twenty pounds of flesh and oil daily. But the most
marvellous account of gormandizing powers is that
published by Captain Cochrane, who in his <i>Narrative
of a Pedestrian Journey through Russia and Siberian
Tartary</i>, says, that the Russian Admiral, Saritcheff, was
told that one of the Yakuti consumed in twenty-four
hours, ‘the hind quarter of a large ox, twenty pounds of
fat, and a proportionate quantity of melted butter for his
drink.’ The Admiral, to test the truth of the statement,
gave him ‘a thick porridge of rice, boiled down
with three pounds of butter, weighing together twenty-eight
pounds; and although the glutton had already
breakfasted, yet did he sit down to it with great eagerness,
and consumed the whole without stirring from the
spot; and, except that his stomach betrayed more than
ordinary fulness, he showed no sign of inconvenience
or injury!’ The traveller I have just quoted also
states, that he has repeatedly seen a Yakut, or Tongouse,
devour forty pounds of meat a day; and he adds,
‘I have seen three of these gluttons consume a reindeer
at one meal.’</p>

<p>It has been well remarked by Dr. Dieffenbach, in the
<i>Transactions of the Ethnological Society</i>, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
labours of modern chemistry have thrown a new and
most interesting light on the food of the various races
of men, or inhabitants of parts of the globe which
are widely different from each other in their geographical
and climatological relations. The substances which
serve as food, or the quantity which is taken, appear
to the superficial observer often of a most extraordinary
nature, because they are apparently so heterogeneous from
what we are accustomed to; so that travellers relating
such facts, do not withhold their astonishment or reprobation.</p>

<p>But it has been demonstrated, that the general use
of certain articles, for instance, tea and coffee, betel-nut,
tobacco, and wine, depends upon the presence in those
substances of elements which are often identical, and
which are necessary to the maintenance of the animal
economy, more or less, according to the presence or
absence of other elements in the food, the different
occupation, mode of living, and so on. These points
have been well illustrated and explained in the <i>Chemistry
of Common Life</i>, of the late Professor Johnston.
The fact of the Esquimaux consuming large quantities
of train oil and blubber ceases to be astonishing, when
we reflect that these highly carbonized substances serve
to furnish fuel for his increased respiration.</p>

<p>In one word, it is necessary in the present state of
chemical and physiological science, to collect analyses
of all the substances which are consumed by a particular
race, either as food or drink, or by an habitual
custom, as so called matters of luxury, or as medicine.
The ethnologist has the great merit of working
here hand in hand with chemists and physiologists, and
fills up in this manner a most important chapter in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
natural history of man; as it shows how instinct and
necessity have led him to adopt different customs, and
to make use of different articles of consumption in different
climates.</p>

<p>Among the ordinary domestic animals, there is little of
novelty in the food they supply to man. But I may
notice in passing, before proceeding to an investigation
of unusual or extraordinary articles of consumption,
a few things that may not be generally known.</p>

<p>Jerked beef, or <i>tasajo</i>, as it is termed in Cuba, is
imported to the extent of 200 to 350 thousand quintals
a year into that island, for feeding the slaves on the
plantations.</p>

<p>That imported from Buenos Ayres and Monte Video
is preferred for consumption on the sugar estates, to
that which is received from Rio Grande, Venezuela,
Campeachy, and the United States, it being more substantial,
coming in larger and thicker pieces, better cured
and salted, and also of handsomer appearance. The
class imported from Venezuela and Campeachy, comes
in thin pieces called <i>rebenque</i>, which is not generally
liked, and only bought in small parcels, for consumption
in the city of Havana. The beef which is cured in
the River Plate, from December to May, or in summer,
is preferred in Cuba, by reason of its being more nutritive
than that which is cured in the other or winter months;
the colour is yellowish, and it keeps a longer time.</p>

<p>In South America, the jerked beef is called <i>charqui</i>,
and when salted, and smoked or dried in the sun, <i>sesina</i>.
The commerce is very large in this species of provision.</p>

<p>The mode of preparing it in Chili is as follows:—When
the horned cattle are sufficiently fat, or rather at the
killing season, which is about the months of February<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and March, from 500 to 1000, according to the size of
the farm, are slaughtered. The whole of the fat is
separated from the meat and melted, forming a kind of
lard, called <i>grasa</i>, which is employed for domestic purposes.
The tallow is also kept separate, and the meat
is jerked. This process is performed by cutting the
fleshy substance into slices of about a quarter-of-an-inch
thick, leaving out all the bones. The natives are
so dexterous at this work that they will cut the whole of
a leg, or any other large part of a bullock, into one
uniformly thin piece.</p>

<p>The meat thus cut is either dipped into a very strong
solution of salt and water, or rubbed over with a small
quantity of fine salt. Whichever mode is adopted, the
whole of the jerked meat is put on the hide, and
rolled up for ten or twelve hours, or until the following
morning. It is then hung on lines or poles to dry in
the sun, which being accomplished, it is made into
bundles, lashed with thongs of fresh hide, forming a kind
of network, and is ready for market. In this operation it
loses about one-third of its original weight. The dried
meat, or <i>charqui</i>, finds immediate sale at Lima, Arica,
Guayaquil, Panama, and other places. About 6000 quintals
of <i>charqui</i>, with a proportionate quantity of tallow
and fat (<i>grasa</i>) are shipped from Talcahuana to Lima
alone. Besides the large quantity consumed in Chili, it
furnishes a great part of the food of the slaves in Brazil,
the negroes in some of the West India Islands, and
seamen, being the general substitute for salt beef and
pork. The <i>grasa</i> and tallow are also readily sold throughout
South America, and are of more value than the meat.</p>

<p>The slaughtering season is as much a time of diversion
for the inhabitants of that country as a sheep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
shearing is in England. The females too are all busied
cutting up the fat, frying it for <i>grasa</i>, and selecting
some of the finer meat for presents and home consumption.
The tongue is the only part of the head that
is eaten, the remainder being left to rot.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Dried
meat enters largely into consumption in several other
countries.</p>

<p>In the Cape Colony dried meat is called <i>biltonge</i>. In
the East, especially in Siam, the dried sinews of animals
are considered a great delicacy; and dried elephant’s
flesh we shall find is stored up for food, under the name
of <i>pastoormah</i>. Beef is preserved in Asia Minor with
garlic and pepper, and dried in the sun for winter food.
It is prepared in Wallachia and Moldavia, and largely
shipped from Varna in the Black Sea. Besides providing
all Anatolia, Aleppo, and Damascus, 6000 cwt.
or more is yearly sent from Kaissariah to Constantinople.
Hung beef from Germany is well known at
our tables.</p>

<p>Portable and concentrated animal food is of great
consequence to explorers and travellers, and therefore it
may be well to allude here to the article <i>pemmican</i>,
which is so much used by arctic travellers and the Hudson’s
Bay Company’s traders. This is meat of any
kind dried and pounded, and saturated with fat. There
is as much nourishment in one pound of pemmican as in
four pounds of ordinary meat. It may be eaten as it
is, or partially cooked, and has a pleasant taste. Sometimes
it is mixed with a sufficient quantity of Indian
meal and water to cause it to adhere, and then fried or
stewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>The North American Indians dry their venison by
exposing thin slices to the heat of the sun, on a
stage, under which a small fire is kept, more for the
purpose of driving away the flies than for promoting
exsiccation; and then they pound it between two stones
on a bison hide. In this process the pounded meat is
contaminated by a greater or smaller admixture of hair
and other impurities.</p>

<p>The fat, which is generally the suet of the bison, is
added by the traders, who purchase it separately from
the natives, and they complete the process by sewing
up the pemmican in a bag of undressed hide, with the
hairy side outwards. Each of these bags weighs 90 lbs.,
and obtains from the Canadian voyageurs the designation
of ‘un taureau.’ A superior pemmican is produced by
mixing finely powdered meat, sifted from impurities,
with marrow fat, and the dried fruit of the Amilanchier.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson having been employed by government
to prepare pemmican on a large scale, at the
Victualling Yard, Gosport, for the use of the different
arctic expeditions, it will be interesting to describe the
process he adopted, as given in his <i>Arctic Searching
Expedition, or a Journal of a Boat Voyage, &amp;c.</i>—</p>

<p>‘The round or buttock of beef of the best quality
having been cut into thin steaks, from which the fat
and membraneous parts were pared away, was dried in
a malt kiln, over an oak fire, until its moisture was
entirely dissipated, and the fibre of the meat became
friable. It was then ground in a malt mill, when it
resembled finely grated meat. Being next mixed with
nearly an equal weight of melted beef suet or lard, the preparation
of plain pemmican was complete; but to render it
more agreeable to the unaccustomed palate, a proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of the best Zante currants was added to part of it,
and part of it was sweetened with sugar. Both these
kinds were much approved of in the sequel by the
consumers, but more especially that to which the sugar
had been added. After the ingredients were well incorporated
by stirring, they were transferred to tin
canisters, capable of containing 85 lbs. each; and
having been firmly rammed down and allowed to contract
further by cooling, the air was completely expelled
and excluded by filling the canister to the brim with
melted lard, through a small hole left in the end, which
was then covered with a piece of tin and soldered up.</p>

<p>‘As the meat in drying loses more than three-fourths
of its original weight, the quantity required was considerable,
being 35,651 lbs. (reduced by drying to about
8000 lbs.); and the sudden abstraction of more than one
thousand rounds of beef, from Leadenhall Market, occasioned
speculation among the dealers, and a rise in the
price of a penny per pound, with an equally sudden fall
when the extra demand was found to be very temporary.’</p>

<p>We import about 13 or 14 tons of gelatine a year
from France, besides what is made at home, and the
greater part of what passes under this name is, I believe,
used for food. The Americans, some years ago, tried
to pass off upon us isinglass made from fish bones, but it
would not go down.</p>

<p>Gelatine of all kinds has usually been considered
wholesome and nourishing; and while few object to
cow-heel or calf’s foot jelly, very many are possibly
unaware of the sources of much of the gelatine vended
in shapes so beautifully transparent, but which is made
from bones and hide clippings, and parchment shavings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
It is said that a pair of lady’s gloves have ere now made
a ragout; and there is a hiatus in the parchment specifications
at the Patent Office, caused by an unlucky
boy, who changed them away for tarts, in order that
they might be converted into jellies.</p>

<p>The dust of the ivory turner in working up elephants’
tusks forms an excellent material for jellies, and is commonly
sold for this purpose, at about 6<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>

<p>M. Payen has recently been at pains to disprove the
vulgar notion that bones make good soup. The celebrated
<i>Gelatine Commission</i>, some years ago, declared,
as the results of many experiments, that gelatine was
not nutritious; and this result has been repeated in
almost every text-book of physiology as conclusive, and
is adopted by M. Payen, who tests it in another series
of experiments. He boiled in one pot a portion of
beef completely divested of bone, and in another the
bone taken from the beef, with only a little salt. After
five hours’ slow boiling, the liquid from the beef was
perfectly limpid, and of a light amber colour, leaving
that aroma and delicate taste known to belong to good
beef tea. The liquid from the bones was whitish-gray,
troubled and opaque, having a very slight odour, and a
not agreeable taste. Nothing could be more opposed
than the two soups thus produced. In another experiment,
he repeated this process with the addition of
some vegetables, and even some drops of caramel. The
beef-soup here maintained its delicious aroma, agreeably
combined with that of the vegetables; its limpidity
was the same, but its colour of course stronger. The
bone-soup had a dominant odour of vegetables, but its
troubled and opaque aspect made it very unappetising.
From these experiments M. Payen concludes that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
prejudice in favour of the addition of bones to the soup
is a prejudice, and that, in fact, bones are not at all
nutritious.</p>

<p>Liebig also, in his <i>Letters on Chemistry</i>, pp. 424 and
425, says:—‘It has now been proved by the most convincing
experiments, that gelatine, which by itself is
tasteless, and when eaten excites nausea, possesses no nutritive
value; that even when accompanied by the savoury
constituents of flesh, it is not capable of supporting the
vital process, and when added to the usual diet as a
substitute for plastic matter, does not increase, but on
the contrary diminishes the nutritive value of the food,
which it renders insufficient in quantity and inferior in
quality; and that its use is hurtful rather than beneficial,
because it does not, like the non-nitrogenous substances
provided by nature for respiration, disappear in
the body without leaving a residue, but overloads with
nitrogenous products, the presence of which disturbs
and impedes the organic processes.’ And he further
observes, that ‘the only difference between this and
joiner’s glue is its greater price.’ Jellies no doubt
were considered most nutritious during the Peninsular
war, but we have learned many things since then, of
which our poor soldiers ought to have the benefit.</p>

<p>Portable soup is prepared in a very simple manner.
The meat is boiled, and the scum taken off as it rises,
until the soup possesses the requisite flavour. ‘It is then
suffered to cool, in order that the fat may be separated.
In the next place it is mixed with the whites of five or
six eggs, and slightly boiled—this operation serves to
clarify the liquid, by the removal of opaque particles,
which unite with the white of egg, at the time it becomes
solid by the heat, and are consequently removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
along with it. The liquor is then to be strained through
flannel, and evaporated on the water bath, to the consistence
of a very thick paste, after which it is spread
rather thin upon a smooth stone, then cut into cakes,
and lastly dried in a stove, until it becomes brittle.
These cakes may be kept four or five years, if defended
from moisture. When intended to be used, nothing
more is required to be done than to dissolve a sufficient
quantity in boiling water.’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>For some years past there have been imported into
the Continent rather large quantities of dried meat from
the southern countries of America, where it is known
under the name of <i>assayo</i>. It gives a soup nearly
similar to that of fresh meat. Another sort of food
which is prepared in Texas, the <i>meat-biscuit</i>, is generally
used in the American navy; but, although greatly
appreciated at the Great Exhibition of London, it has
not yet entered into general use in Europe. It is made
of boiled beef free from grease, the liquor of which is
evaporated to the consistency of syrup, and this is
mixed with wheaten flour in sufficient proportion to
form a solid paste. This paste is then spread out by
a rolling pin, is pierced with a number of little holes,
is cut into the ordinary dimensions of sea biscuits, and
then baked and properly dried. The biscuit is eaten
dry, or may be broken, boiled in twenty or thirty times
its weight in water, for from twenty-five to thirty
minutes, and then seasoned with salt or other things.</p>

<p>The following is the process of manufacturing this
biscuit:—</p>

<p>There are four wooden caldrons or tubs for boiling
the meat and evaporating the liquid or broth—the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
for boiling the meat, holding 2,300 gallons, will each
boil 7,000 lbs. of meat in twelve to sixteen hours. The
other two, for evaporating, will contain some 1,400
gallons each. All the tubs are heated or boiled by
steam passing through long coiled iron pipes, supplied
at pleasure, either from the escape steam from the engine,
or direct from the boiler.</p>

<p>When the meat is so far boiled or macerated, that
the liquid or broth contains the entire nutriment, the
meaty, or solid portions are separated by a simple
process of filtering, so that the broth goes into the evaporator
pure and free from fibrous matter. It is then
evaporated to a degree of consistency resembling the
golden or Stewart’s sugar house syrup, its uniform
density being determined by a liquid or syrup gauge.
Two pounds of this syrup or extract contains the nutriment
of some eleven pounds of meat (including its
usual proportion of bone) as first put into the caldron.
This is then mixed with the best and finest flour,
kneaded and made into biscuit by means of machines.
The biscuit is baked upon pans in an oven so constructed
as to produce an uniform firmness. The
proportion is as two pounds of extract are to three
pounds of flour, but by baking, the five pounds of dough
is reduced to four pounds of biscuit, and this will make
what the inventor claims—the nutriment of over five
pounds of meat in one pound of bread, which contains,
besides, over ten ounces of flour.</p>

<p>The biscuit resembles in appearance a light coloured
sugar-cake. It is packed in air-tight casks or tin canisters
of different sizes, part of the biscuit being pulverized
by grinding in a mill for the purpose, and then
packed with the whole biscuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>In discussing the extension of our resources of animal
food, it is strange to notice that while we eat the blood
of pigs and fowls, we throw aside as waste the blood of
oxen, sheep, goats, calves, &amp;c. Now blood contains all
the principles out of which the tissues are formed,
and must, one would therefore imagine, be eminently
nutritious. Why prejudice has excluded these, while
admitting the blood of pigs, is an anomaly which I
cannot understand.</p>

<p>In France, where there are not, as in America, large
quantities of animals which are killed simply for the
sake of their hides, it would be impossible to prepare or
supply at a low price either the assayo or the meat biscuit;
but the idea of using the blood of animals killed,
which blood is at present wasted without profit, or, at
best, is used as manure, might have occurred to some
one. M. Brocchieri has conceived this idea. In treating
the blood of our slaughter-houses by means which
he has invented, and uniting to flour of the best quality,
the albumen and fibrine which he extracts from it—he
makes bread and biscuits which are easily preserved, and
which may be employed to make very nutritious soups.</p>

<p>At the Great Exhibition, in 1851, he produced <i>bon-bons</i>
made of the blood of the ox, cow, sheep, and hog;
biscuits and patties of the blood of the bull, and delicacies
made of calves’ blood. I have specimens of these
preserved in my private museum, although I have not
ventured to taste them.</p>

<p>Generally speaking in England, we do not do much
with the blood of animals, at least, in the shape of food—unless
it be in those strings of black-puddings, with
tempting little bits of fat stuck in them, which stare us
in the face in some shops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>But M. Brocchieri has attempted to utilize the nutritious
principles of the blood of animals killed for food,
by reducing it to a concentrated and dried state, for
preservation during long periods. The first step is to
prepare a liquid, considered innocuous and antiseptic
by the inventor, by which various bloods are kept fluid
and apparently fresh. Samples of these were shown,
and the series of specimens illustrated the solid parts
forming the crassamentum or clot, in a dried and semi-crystalline
state. These solid constituents, including
the gelatine, albumen, and fibrine are next produced,
combined with small proportions of flour, in the form
of light, dry masses, like loaves, cakes, or biscuits.
These are inodorous, almost flavourless, and may be
made the bases of highly nutritious soups. They are
very uniform in composition, containing half the nitrogen
of dried blood, or forty-four per cent. of dry flesh,
the equivalent of double the nutritive value of ordinary
butcher’s meat. Both the bull’s and calf’s blood gave
6·6 per cent. of nitrogen, equal to forty-three per
cent. of flesh-forming principles. Combined with sugar,
the cakes have been made into <i>bon-bons</i>.</p>

<p>The evidence, as to the value of the process, in preserving
the samples in an undecomposed state, is now
satisfactorily arrived at. It was stated in 1851, that
the preparations had been advantageously employed in
long voyages. The samples I have in my collection
have now been kept seven years, and have not shown
any tendency to decay. Thus proving that the first
attempt has been successful, in rendering available for
food, and portable in form, the otherwise wasted blood
of cattle.</p>

<p>This notice of blood recalls to my recollection a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
laughable story told in a French work, of the life of an
unfortunate pig.</p>

<p>‘A French curé, exiled to a deserted part of our
forests—and who, the whole year, except on a few rare
occasions, lived only on fruit and vegetables—hit upon
a most admirable expedient for providing an animal repast
to set before the curés of the neighbourhood, when
one or the other, two or three times during the year,
ventured into those dreadful solitudes, with a view of
assuring himself with his own eyes that his unfortunate
colleague had not yet died of hunger. The curé in
question possessed a pig, his whole fortune: and you
will see the manner in which he used it. Immediately
the bell announced a visitor, and that his cook had shown
his clerical friend into the parlour, the master of the
house, drawing himself up majestically, said to his
housekeeper: ‘Brigitte, let there be a good dinner for
myself and my friend.’ Brigitte, although she knew
there were only stale crusts and dried peas in her larder,
seemed in no degree embarrassed by this order;
she summoned to her assistance ‘Toby the Carrot,’
so called because his head was as red as that of a native
of West Galloway, and leaving the house together, they
both went in search of the pig. This, after a short
skirmish, was caught by Brigitte and her carroty assistant;
and, notwithstanding his cries, his grunts, his
gestures of despair, and supplication, the inhuman cook,
seizing his head, opened a large vein in his throat, and
relieved him of two pounds of blood; this, with the addition
of garlic, shalots, mint, wild thyme, and parsley,
was converted into a most savoury and delicious black-pudding
for the curé and his friend, and being served
to their reverences smoking hot on the summit of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
pyramid of yellow cabbage, figured admirably as a
small Vesuvius and a centre dish. The surgical operation
over, Brigitte, whose qualifications as a seamstress
were superior, darned up the hole in the neck of the
unfortunate animal: and as he was then turned loose
until a fresh supply of black-puddings should be required
for a similar occasion, this wretched pig was
never happy. How could he be so? Like Damocles of
Syracuse, he lived in a state of perpetual fever; terror
seized him directly he heard the curé’s bell, and seeing
in imagination the uplifted knife already about to glide
into his bosom, he invariably took to his heels before
Brigitte was half-way to the door to answer it. If, as
usual, the peal announced a diner-out, Brigitte and
Gold-button were soon on his track, calling him by the
most tender epithets, and promising that he should
have something nice for his supper—skim-milk, &amp;c.,—but
the pig with his painful experience was not
such a fool as to believe them. Hidden behind an old
cask, some fagots, or lying in a deep ditch, he remained
silent as the grave, and kept himself close as long as
possible. Discovered, however, he was sure to be at
last, when he would rush into the garden, and, running
up and down like a mad creature, upset everything in
his way. For several minutes it was a regular steeplechase—across
the beds, now over the turnips, then
through the gooseberry-bushes—in short, he was here,
there, and everywhere; but, in spite of all his various
stratagems to escape the fatal incision, the poor pig
always finished by being seized, tied, thrown on the
ground, and bled: the vein was then once more cleverly
sewn up, and the inhuman operators quietly retired
from the scene to make the curé’s far-famed black-pudding.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Half-dead upon the spot where he was phlebotomized,
the wretched animal was left to reflect under
the shade of a tree on the cruelty of man, on their
barbarous appetites; cursing with all his heart the
poverty of Morvinian curates, their conceited hospitality,
of which he was the victim, and their brutal
affection for pig’s blood.’</p>

<p>Sir George Simpson, speaking of some of the
northern tribes of Indians in America, says, the flexibility
of their stomachs is surprising. At one time they
will gorge themselves with food, and are then prepared
to go without any for several days, if necessary.</p>

<p>Enter their tents; sit there if you can for a whole
day, and not for an instant will you find the fire unoccupied
by persons of all ages cooking. When not
hunting or travelling, they are in fact always eating.
Now it is a little roast, a partridge or rabbit perhaps;
now a tit-bit, broiled under the ashes; anon a portly
kettle, well filled with venison, swings over the fire;
then comes a choice dish of curdled blood, followed by
the sinews and marrow-bones of deer’s legs, singed on
the embers. And so the grand business of life goes
unceasingly round, interrupted only by sleep.</p>

<p>Dining within the arctic circle, when such a thing as
dinner is to be had, is a much more serious matter than
when one undergoes that pleasing ceremony at a first-rate
eating house, hotel, or club.</p>

<p>In arctic banquets, the cheerful glass is often frozen
to the lip, or the too ardent reveller splinters a tooth in
attempting to gnaw through a lump of soup. We, in
these temperate climes, have never had the pleasure of
<i>eating</i> ship’s rum, or <i>chewing</i> brandy and water. It is
not only necessary to ‘first catch your fish,’ but also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
essential to <i>thaw</i> it; and there is no chance of the fish
being limber, although it is not unusual for heat to
bring them to life after they have been frozen stiff a
couple of days. In the arctic circle even the very musquitoes,
which, by the way, are frightfully large and
numerous, become torpid with the intense cold, and are
frozen into hard masses, which the heat of the sun, or
fire, may restore to animation.</p>

<p>Dr. Sutherland, in his voyage in Baffin’s Bay, says—‘It
was necessary to be very careful with our drinking
cups. Tin never suited, for it always adhered to the
lips, and took a portion of the skin along with it. A
dog attempting to lick a little fat from an iron shovel
stuck fast to it, and dragged it by means of his tongue,
until by a sudden effort, he got clear, leaving several
inches of the skin and adjacent tissue on the cold metal.
One of the seamen, endeavouring to change the size of
the eye of the splice in his tack-rope, put the marling
spike, after the true sailor fashion, into his mouth; the
result was that he lost a great portion of his lips and
tongue.’</p>

<p>We hear frequent jokes of the partiality of the Russians
for tallow candles, and, like all inhabitants of the polar
regions, the Esquimaux are very fond of fat, the physiology
of their craving for fat is now known to everybody.
My esteemed friend, the late Mr. Hooper, one of the officers
of H.M.S. <i>Plover</i>, in his account of his residence on
the shores of Arctic America, states, that ‘one of the
ladies who visited them was presented, as a jest, with a
small tallow candle, called a purser’s dip. It was, notwithstanding,
a very pleasant joke to the damsel, who
deliberately munched it up with evident relish, and
finally, drew the wick between her set teeth to clean off
any remaining morsels of fat.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>He gives also in detail, the history of a Tuski repast
of the most sumptuous nature, to which he and his
companions were invited, and I must find room for
some portion of it.</p>

<p>‘First was brought in, on a huge wooden tray, a
number of small fish, uncooked, but intensely frozen.
At these all the natives set to work, and we essayed,
somewhat ruefully it must be confessed, to follow their
example; but, being all unused to such gastronomic process,
found ourselves, as might be expected, rather at a
loss how to commence. From this dilemma, however,
our host speedily extricated us, by practical demonstration
of the correct mode of action; and, under his certainly
very able tuition, we shortly became more expert.
But, alas! a new difficulty was soon presented; our native
companions, we presume, either made a hasty bolt
of each morsel, or had, perhaps, a relish for the flavour
of the viands now under consideration. Not so ourselves—it
was sadly repugnant to our palates; for, aided
by the newly-acquired knowledge that the fish were in
the same condition as when taken from the water,
uncleaned and unembowelled, we speedily discovered
that we could neither bolt nor retain the fragments,
which, by the primitive aid of teeth and nails, we had
rashly detached for our piscatorial share. It was to no
purpose that our host pressed us to ‘fall to;’ we could
not manage the consumption of this favourite preparation
(or rather lack thereof), and succeeded with difficulty
in evading his earnest solicitations. The next
course was a mess of green stuff, looking as if carefully
chopped up, and this was also hard frozen. To it was
added a lump of blubber, which the lady presiding, who
did all the carving, dexterously cut into slices with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
knife like a cheesemonger’s, and apportioned out at different
quarters of the huge tray before mentioned, which
was used throughout the meal, together with a modicum
of the grass-like stuff, to the company; the only distinction
in favour of the strangers and guests of high
degree being, that their slices were cut much thinner
than for the rest. We tasted this compound, and ...
we didn’t like it: at this no one will wonder—the
blubber speaks for itself; and the other stuff, which really
was not very unpalatable, we discovered in after-times
to be the unruminated food of reindeer which had been
slaughtered—at least, so we were told: but I am not
quite clear on this point. Our dislike to the dish had
no offensive effect upon our host, who only seemed to be
astonished at our strange want of taste, and, with the
rest of the guests, soon cleared the board; the managing
dame putting the finishing stroke by a rapid sweep of
her not too scrupulously clean fingers over the dish, by
way of clearing off the fragments to prepare for the
reception of the next delicacy. After this interesting
operation she conveyed her digits to her mouth, and,
engulfing them for a brief period, withdrew them,
quite in apple pie order once more. The board was
now again replenished, this time with viands less repellent
to our unnurtured tastes. Boiled seal and walrus
flesh appeared, and our hospitable friends were
greatly relieved when they beheld us assist in the consumption
of these items, which, being utterly devoid of
flavour, were distasteful only from their extreme toughness
and mode of presentation; but we did not, of
course, desire to appear too singular or squeamish.
Next came a portion of whale’s flesh, or rather whale’s
skin. This was perfectly ebony in hue, and we discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
some apprehensions respecting its fitness as an
article of food; but our fears were groundless. It was
cut and re-cut crosswise into diminutive cubes; venturing
upon one of which we were agreeably surprised to
find it possessing a cocoa-nut flavour, like which it also
cut, ‘very short;’ indeed, so much astonished were we
on this occasion, that we had consumed a very considerable
number of these cubes, and with great relish
too, before we recovered from our wonder. The dish
was ever afterwards a favourite with me. On its disappearance,
a very limited quantity of boiled reindeer
meat, fresh and fat, was served up, to which we did
ample justice; then came portions of the gum of the
whale, in which the ends of the bone lay still embedded;
and I do not hesitate to declare that this was perfectly
delicious, its flavour being, as nearly as I can find a
parallel, like that of cream cheese. This, which the
Tuski call their sugar, was the wind-up to the repast and
ourselves, and we were fain to admit that, after the rather
unpleasant auspices with which our feast commenced,
the finale was by no means to be contemned.’</p>

<p>A merchant at a banquet to which he was invited
with several respectable Greenlanders, counted the following
dishes:—Dried herrings; dried seal’s flesh; the
same boiled; half-raw, or putrid seal’s flesh, called
Mikiak; boiled auks; part of a whale’s tail in a half-putrid
state, which was considered as a principal dish;
dried salmon; dried reindeer venison; preserves of
crow-berries mixed with the chyle from the maw of the
reindeer; and lastly, the same enriched with train oil.</p>

<p>Dr. Kane, enumerating arctic delicacies, says, ‘Our
journeys have taught us the wisdom of the Esquimaux
appetite, and there are few among us who do not relish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
a slice of raw blubber or a chunk of frozen walrus-beef.
The liver of a walrus (awuktanuk), eaten with little
slices of his fat—of a verity it is a delicious morsel.
Fire would ruin the curt, pithy expression of vitality
which belongs to its uncooked juices. Charles Lamb’s
roast pig was nothing to awuktanuk. I wonder that
raw beef is not eaten at home. Deprived of extraneous
fibre, it is neither indigestible nor difficult to
masticate. With acids and condiments, it makes a
salad which an educated palate cannot help relishing;
and as a powerful and condensed heat-making and antiscorbutic
food, it has no rival. I make this last broad
assertion after carefully testing its truth. The natives
of South Greenland prepare themselves for a long
journey in the cold by a course of frozen seal. At
Upernavik they do the same with the narwhal, which
is thought more heat-making than the seal; while the
bear, to use their own expression, is ‘stronger travel
than all.’ In Smith’s Sound, where the use of raw
meat seems almost inevitable from the modes of living
of the people, walrus holds the first rank. Certainly
this pachyderm, whose finely-condensed tissue and delicately-permeating
fat—(oh! call it not blubber)—assimilate
it to the ox, is beyond all others, and is the
very best fuel a man can swallow. It became our
constant companion whenever we could get it; and a
frozen liver upon our sledge was valued far above the
same weight of pemmican.’</p>

<p>Mr. Augustus Petermann, in a paper upon Animal
Life in the Arctic Regions, read before the Royal Geographical
Society, thus enumerates the food resources:—</p>

<p>‘Though several classes of the animal creation, as
for example, the reptiles, are entirely wanting in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
region, those of the mammals, birds, and fishes, at
least, bear comparison both as to number and size with
those of the Tropics: the lion, the elephant, the hippopotamus,
and others not being more notable in the latter
respect than the polar bear, the musk ox, the walrus,
and, above all, the whale. Besides these, there are the
moose, the reindeer, the wolf, the polar hare, the seal, and
various smaller quadrupeds. The birds consist chiefly
of an immense number of aquatic birds. Of fishes, the
salmon, salmon trout, and herring, are the principal, the
latter especially crowding in such myriads as to surpass
everything of that kind found in tropical regions.</p>

<p>‘Nearly all these animals furnish wholesome food for
men. They are, with few exceptions, distributed over
the entire regions: their number, however, or the relative
intensity of the individuals, is very different in
different parts. Thus, on the American side, we find
the animals decreasing in number from east to west.
On the shores of Davis’ Straits, in Baffin’s Bay, Lancaster
Sound, Regent Inlet, &amp;c., much less in number
are met with than in Boothia Felix, and Parry groups.
The abundance of animal life in Melville Island and
Victoria Channel, is probably not surpassed in any other
part on the American side. Proceeding westward to the
Russian possessions, we find considerable numbers of
animals all round and within the sea of Kamtschatka,
as also to the north of Behring’s Straits. The yearly
produce of the Russian Fur Company, in America, is
immense, and formerly it was much greater. Pribylon,
when he discovered the small islands named after
him, collected, within two years, 2,000 skins of sea
otters, 40,000 sea bears, (ursine seals,) 6,000 dark sea
foxes, and 1,000 walrus-teeth. Lütke, in his <i>Voyage</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
<i>Round the World</i>, mentions that, in the year 1803,
800,000 skins of the ursine seal alone were accumulated
in Unataski, one of the depôts of the Russian
Fur Company, 700,000 of which were thrown into the
sea, partly because they were badly prepared, and
partly to keep up the prices. But in no other part of
the arctic zoological region is animal life so abundant
as in the northern parts of Siberia, especially between
the Rivers Kolyma and Lena.</p>

<p>‘The first animals that make their appearance after
the dreary winter, are large flights of swans, geese,
ducks, and snipes; these are killed by old and young.
Fish also begin to be taken in nets and baskets placed
under the ice.</p>

<p>‘In June, however, when the river opens, the fish
pour in in immense numbers. At the beginning of this
century, several thousand geese were sometimes killed
in one day at the mouth of the River Kolyma. About
twenty years later, when Admiral Wrangel visited
those regions, the numbers had somewhat decreased,
and it was then called a good season when 1,000 geese,
5,000 ducks, and 200 swans were killed at that place.
The reindeer chase forms the next occupation for the
inhabitants. About the same time, the shoals of herrings
begin to ascend the rivers, and the multitudes of
these fish are often such that, in three or four days,
40,000 may be taken with a single net.</p>

<p>‘On the banks of the River Indejiska the number of
swans and geese resorting there in the moulting season,
is said to be much greater even than on the River
Kolyma.’</p>

<p>The choicest dish of the Greenlanders is the flesh
of the reindeer. But as those animals have now become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
extremely scarce, and several of them are soon
consumed by a hunting party, they are indebted to the
sea for their permanent sustenance, seals, fish, and sea-fowl.
Hares and partridges are in no great estimation
as delicacies. The head and fins of the seal are preserved
under the grass in summer, and in winter a whole
seal is frequently buried in the snow. The flesh, half
frozen, half putrid, in which state the Greenlanders
term it mikiak, is eaten with the keenest appetite.
The ribs are dried in the air and laid up in store. The
remaining parts of the seal, as well as birds and small
fishes, are eaten, well boiled or stewed with a small
quantity of sea-water. On the capture of a seal, the
wound is immediately stopped up to preserve the
blood, which is rolled into balls like forcemeat.</p>

<p>The intestines of small animals are eaten without
any further preparation than that of pressing out the
contents between the fingers.</p>

<p>They set a great value on what they find in the
reindeer’s maw, making it into a dish which they call
Nerukak (the eatable), and send presents of it to their
friends. The entrails of the rypeu, mixed with fresh
train oil and berries, compose another mess which they
consider as a consummate delicacy. Their preserves
for winter are composed of fresh, rotten and half-hatched
eggs, crake berries, and angelica, thrown together into
a sack of seal skin, filled up with train oil. They likewise
suck out the fat from the skins of sea-fowls; and,
in dressing seal skins, they scrape off the grease which
could not well be separated in the skinning, to make a
kind of pancake.</p>

<p>In the second voyage of Sir John Ross to the arctic
regions, it is related of the steward, that he purchased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
a sledge of the Esquimaux, and on examining it, it was
found to be made of salmon, with skins sewed over
them; but the cross pieces were the leg bones of the
reindeer. It was not an erroneous conjecture of some
of the crew, that when these poor creatures are driven
to extremity for food, they turn to and make a dainty
meal of their sledges, as, with the exception of the
reindeer bones, the whole of them is eatable. When
we refer to the description which the late Sir John
Franklin gives of the different articles of food by which
he and his party were maintained, the component parts
of the sledge of an Esquimaux would, under circumstances
of extreme want, be considered a real dainty.</p>

<p>There cannot be any comparison between a meal of
<i>tripe de roche</i> and the stinking marrow of a reindeer
bone, and a piece of dried salmon, which by its exposure
to the frost has been kept from putridity; indeed,
the epicures amongst the Esquimaux do not hesitate to
declare, that the flavor of the salmon is rather enhanced
by its long keeping, on the same principle we suppose
that the flavour of game of this country rises in the
estimation of the epicure in proportion as the bird or
animal approaches to putridity. At all events, it must
be a novel and curious exhibition, to observe a party of
Esquimaux cutting up a sledge, and carving out pieces
of salmon, according to their respective tastes, and
seasoning them with some of the oil extracted from
the blubber of the whale. The latter condiment is to
the Esquimaux what Burgess’ anchovy is to the citizen
of London; and instances are not rare, in which an
Esquimaux has been known to devour four pounds of
seal flesh, or of salmon, well soaked in whale oil, at one
meal, with about half-a-gallon of water as the beverage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Much of the animal food comes frozen to the markets
of St. Petersburg. The sledges which bring it are
used as stalls to sell it. The matting is thrown aside,
and the poultry and frozen carcases are arranged
so as to attract buyers. Whole sledge loads of snow-white
hares find their way to the market. The little
animals are usually frozen in a running position, with
their ears pointed, and their legs stretched out before
and behind, and when placed on the ground, look at a
first glance as if they were in the act of escaping from
the hunter.</p>

<p>Bear’s flesh is also sometimes offered for sale in the
market, and here and there may be seen a frozen reindeer
lying in the snow, by the side of a booth, its
hairy snout stretched forth upon the ground, its knees
doubled up under its body, and its antlers rising majestically
into the air. It looks as if on our approaching
it, it would spring up and dash away once more in search
of its native forests.</p>

<p>The mighty elk is likewise no rare guest in this
market, where it patiently presents its antlers as a
perch for the pigeons that are fluttering about, till,
little by little, the axe and the saw have left no fragment
of the stately animal, but every part of the carcase
has gone its way into the kitchens of the wealthy.</p>

<p>The geese are cut up, and the heads, necks, legs, and
carcases sold separately by the dozen, or half dozen,
strung upon small cords. Those who cannot afford to
dine on the breast of a goose, purchase a string of
frozen heads, or a few dozen of webbed feet, to boil
down into soup. The frozen oxen, calves, and goats,
stand around in rows. Sucking pigs are a favourite delicacy
with the Russians. Hundreds of these, in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
frozen state, are seen ranged about the sledges, mingled
with large frozen hogs.</p>

<p>The bones and meat being all rendered equally hard
by the frost, the animals are sawn up into a number of
slices, of an inch or two in thickness, and by this operation
a quantity of animal sawdust is scattered on the
snow, and afterwards gathered up by poor children,
who haunt the market for that purpose. Fish, which
is offered for sale, is sawn and sold in the same frozen
condition.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>‘If one is to judge from the <i>restaurants</i> at Moscow,’
writes a correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, ‘there is no better
place in the world to come to in order to try the
temper. The best of them is dear and bad beyond
comparison, and the only things good are the wine and
the bread. It must be admitted that the latter is excellent,
light, sweet, white, and wholesome, and our
London bakers would do well if they came to Moscow
for an apprenticeship in the art of making bread. It is
very hard to have to pay 1<i>l.</i> for cabbage soup, <i>filet du
cheval</i>, a bit of bad fish, one stewed pear, and a bottle of
light French wine; but it is harder still to wait for
twenty minutes between every dish, while leaden-eyed
waiters are staring at you with a mixture of contempt
and compassion because of your ignorance of the Russian
tongue. Tired, cross, and dyspeptic, the stranger
seeks a Russian dining room where the arts of French
cookery have never been employed to render bad meat
still worse. There, amid the odours of tobacco—for a
Russian not being able to smoke in the streets makes
up for it <i>chez lui</i>—you resign yourself to an unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
bill of fare and the caprices of your bearded attendant.
It is fair to say of the said waiter, that he is clad in a
milk-white and scrupulously clean robe, which descends
in easy folds from his neck to his heels, so that he looks
like a very high priest of the deity of gastronomy, and
that you need not be as uneasy about his fingers and
hands as you have good cause to be at the Russo-French
<i>restaurants</i>. First you will be presented with a huge
bowl of cabbage soup, a kind of <i>pot-au-feu</i>, which must
be eaten, however, with several odd adjuncts, such as
cakes stuffed with chopped vegetables, a dish of guelots,
chopped fat, fried brown and crisp, and lastly a large
ewer full of sour milk. Then comes a <i>vol-au-vent</i> of
fowl and toad-stools. Next, if you are alive, porosenok,
or a boiled sucking pig, with tart sauce; then a very
nasty little fish, much prized in Moscow, and called
sterlet; a fid of roast beef and a dish of birds about the
size of pigeons, called guillemots; a compote of fruit
closes the meal. I have forgotten to say how it begins.
Before dinner a tray is laid out with caviare, raw salt
herrings, raw ham and sardines, bottles of brandy,
vodka, anisette, and doppel kümmel, a sweet spirit with
a flavour of mint. It is <i>de rigueur</i> to eat some of this,
and as the caviare is generally good, it is the best part
of the dinner.’</p>

<p>The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, in his official
report to the Colonial Office, in 1856, speaking of the
food and cooking in the interior, remarks:—‘An officer
of government, who has been about two years here,
says, that he reckons he has eaten, during that time,
700 fowls, it being difficult at out-stations to cater in
anything else but fowls.</p>

<p>‘In cooking, the natives seem to have almost a homeopathic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
prepossession for trituration. They pound and
grind by hand labour, between stones, their maize, and
bake it; so with their yams, and, I believe, cassada;
they pound also their plantains and make soup of them.</p>

<p>‘Fish with a strong flavour and snails are favorites.
The latter grow to a large, I had almost said formidable,
size. I have in my possession the shell of one
which I found buried about a foot in the ground,
within a few yards of Government house, and which
measures in length about five inches, and in circumference,
in the widest part, about seven inches. A
collection of these snails was once sent to me as a
compliment, but I need hardly say, that I cannot speak
of their taste from experience, though I do not know
why I should not as well as I can of land crabs, which,
when properly cooked, are, I think, general favorites
with us. On the subject of cooking, I may observe,
that the country cooked dishes (if of materials of a nature,
and in a state, admitted in the category of our edibles)
brought to table in the black native-made earthen pots
in which they are cooked on the fire, are almost
without exception favorites with the Europeans.’</p>

<p>The African Bushmen, who have few or no cattle,
live upon what they can get. Hunger compels them
to eat every thing, roots, bulbs, wild garlic, the core of
aloes, the gum of acacias, berries, the larvæ of ants,
lizards, locusts, and grasshoppers—all are devoured by
these poor wanderers of the desert. Nothing comes
amiss to them.</p>

<p>The principal diet of the Kaffir is milk, which he
eats rather than drinks in a sour and curdled state.
One good meal a day, taken in the evening, consisting
of the curdled milk and a little millet, is almost all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
he requires, and with this he is strong, vigorous, and
robust, proving that large quantities of animal food are
by no means necessary for the sustenance of the human
frame.</p>

<p>Singularly enough a Kaffir, like a Jew, will never
touch pork. To him it is unclean, though why he
thinks so I suspect he cannot tell. Fish is likewise
abstained from by him, as it is said to have been by the
Egyptian priesthood. Yet with these antipathies he
will eat the flesh of an ox, cooked or raw, when he can
obtain it, not excepting portions of the animal from which
one would imagine he would turn away with disgust.</p>

<p>To such tribes as the Shangalla negroes, occupying
the wild tracts bordering on Abyssinia, roots are their
daily food, and locusts and lizards their luxuries.</p>

<p>The Indians of Brazil do not reject any kind of food,
and devour it almost without being cooked; rats and
other small vermin, snakes, and alligators, are all
accepted.</p>

<p>The aborigines of Australia live chiefly on the
native animals they can procure—the kangaroo, the
wallaby, bandicoot, kangaroo rat, opossum, and wombat;
every bird and bird’s egg that can be procured; and in
the case of tribes near the sea, cray-fish, and shell-fish,
form the staple article of their diet.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Christianity, the fish, flesh, or
fowl, which the Pacific Islanders previously regarded
as incarnations of their gods, are now eaten without
suspicion or alarm. One, for instance, saw his god in
the eel, another in the shark, another in the turtle, another
in the dog, another in the owl, another in the
lizard; and so on throughout all the fish of the sea, and
birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
some of the shell-fish, even, gods were supposed to be
present. A man would eat freely of what was regarded
as the incarnation of the god of another man, but the incarnation
of his own particular god he would consider
it death to injure or to eat. The god was supposed to
avenge the insult by taking up his abode in that person’s
body, and causing to generate diseases.</p>

<p>The Sonthal, or lowlander of Bengal, being unfettered
by caste, eats without scruple his cow or buffalo beef,
his kids, poultry, pork, or pigeons, and is not over particular
as to whether the animals have been slain, have
died a natural death, or have been torn by wild animals.
When the more substantial good things of life, such as
meat and poultry are scarce, he does not refuse to eat
snakes, ants, frogs, and field rats.</p>

<p>In Eastern Tibet regular meals are not in vogue; the
members of a family do not assemble to dine together,
but ‘eat when they’re hungry, drink when they’re dry.’
‘We remember,’ says a writer in <i>Blackwood</i>, ‘to have
heard a graphic description of the Tibetan <i>cuisine</i>, from
a humorous <i>shikaree</i>, or native Nimrod of our Himalayan
provinces. The Bhoteea folk (he said) have a detestable
way of eating. They take a large cooking pot full
of water, and put in it meat, bread, rice, and what not,
and set it on the fire, where it is always a-simmering.
When hungry, they go and fish out a cupful of whatever
comes uppermost, perhaps, six or seven times a day.
Strangers are served in the same way. If a man gets
hold of a bone, he picks it, wipes his hands on his dress,
and chucks it back into the pot. So with all crumbs
and scraps, back they go into the pot, and thus the
never-ending still-beginning mess stews on.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>If we visit Burmah, we find there a rather indiscriminate
use of all that can satiate the appetite, without
much regard to selection. Immense quantities of pressed
fish are prepared, called <i>gnapee</i>, which constitutes a main
article of their diet. In some cases the fish is washed
and pounded, and this description generally consists
of prawns. In the coarser sorts the pieces of fish are
entire, half putrid, half pickled. They are all fetid
and offensive to Europeans.</p>

<p>A kind of red ant is eaten fried, or with their dried fish,
and a worm, which in the lower provinces of Burmah
is found in the heart of a shrub, is considered such a
delicacy, that every month a great quantity is sent to
the capital to be served up at the table of the emperor.
It is eaten either fried or roasted.</p>

<p>According to Sir John Bowring, the Chinese have no
prejudices whatever as regards food; they eat anything
and everything from which they can derive nutrition.
Dogs, especially puppies, are habitually sold as food.
In the butchers’ shops large dogs skinned and hanging
with their viscera, may be seen by the side of pigs and
goats. Even to the flesh of monkeys and snakes they
have no objection.</p>

<p>The sea slug is an aristocratic and costly delicacy,
which is never wanting, any more than the edible birds-nests,
at a feast where honour is intended to be done to
the guests. These birds-nests are worth twice their
weight in silver. They are glutinous compositions
formed by a kind of swallow, in vast clusters, found in
Java, Sumatra, and the rocky islets of the Indian Archipelago.
Dried sharks’ fins and fish maws are also
highly prized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>But while the rich fare sumptuously, the mass of the
poor subsist on the veriest garbage. The heads of
fowls, their entrails and fat, with every scrap of digestible
animal matter, earth-worms, sea reptiles of all
kinds, mice, and other vermin are greedily devoured.
Lots of black frogs, in half dozens, tied together, are
exposed for sale in shallow troughs of water. The
hind-quarters of a horse will be seen hung up in a
butcher’s shop, with the recommendation of a whole
leg attached.</p>

<p>Unhatched ducks and chickens are a favorite dish.
Nor do the early stages of putrefaction create any disgust.
Rotten eggs are by no means condemned to
perdition. Fish is the more acceptable when it has a
strong fragrance and flavour to give more gusto to the
rice, which forms the two meals of the population,
morning and evening. In the shops, fat pork chops
will be found dried and varnished to the colour of
mahogany, suspended with dry pickled ducks’ gizzards,
and strings of sausages cured by exposure to the sun.</p>

<p>In Hong Kong, rice with salt fish and fat pork
is the principal article of Chinese diet; and for drink,
tea and hot samshew, a spirit distilled from rice, and
very unpalatable to Europeans.</p>

<p>Nearly all the beasts of the forest are eaten by the
Dyaks of Borneo; even monkeys, alligators (if small),
snakes, and other reptiles are esteemed. Like the
French, they regard frogs as a delicate dish, and bestow
considerable pains in procuring them.</p>

<p>The Greenlanders, although they do not usually eat
their meat raw, have a superstitious custom, on every
capture, of cutting out a piece of the raw flesh and
drinking the warm blood. And the woman who skins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the seal, gives a couple of pieces of the fat to each of
the female spectators.</p>

<p>An European writer states, that he frequently followed
the example of the Greenlanders in the chase, and
assuaged his hunger by eating a piece of raw reindeer’s
flesh; nor did he find it very hard of digestion, but
it satisfied his appetite much less than cooked meat.
The inhabitants of the high table-lands of Abyssinia,
are also accustomed to eat raw flesh—the climate
being as cold as that of the northern parts of Scotland.
My friend, Mr. C. Johnston, in his travels in
that country, thus puts in a plea for the practice by the
Abyssinians.</p>

<p>In a country but poorly wooded, the chief supply of
fuel being the dung of cattle, an instinctive feeling,
dependent upon the pleasures of a state of warmth, has
taught the Abyssinians that the flesh of animals eaten
raw, is a source of great physical enjoyment, by the
cordial and warming effects upon the system produced
by its digestion, and to which I am convinced bon vivants
more civilized than the Abyssinians would resort, if
placed in their situation.</p>

<p>Travellers who have witnessed their <i>brunde</i> feasts,
can attest the intoxicating effects of this kind of food,
and they must have been astonished at the immense
quantities that can be eaten in the raw state, compared
to that when the meat is cooked, and at the insensibility
which it sometimes produces.</p>

<p>Eating raw meat, which among the Esquimaux is for
the most part an absolute necessity, by the Abyssinians
is considered a luxury, or in fact, as a kind of dissipation;
for eating it in that state is only indulged in by
them at festivals, and it is then taken as a means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
enjoyment, and is not more barbarous or disgusting
than getting tipsy upon strong drinks.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Another writer on ‘Life in Abyssinia,’ thus describes
the native mode of eating meat.—‘There is usually a
piece of meat to every five or six persons, among whom
arises some show of ceremony as to which of them shall
first help himself; this being at length decided, the person
chosen takes hold of the meat with his left hand,
and with his sword or knife cuts a strip a foot or fifteen
inches long, from the part which appears the nicest
and tenderest. The others then help themselves in
like manner. If I should fail in describing the scene
which now follows, I must request the aid of the
reader’s imagination. Let him picture to himself thirty
or forty Abyssinians, stripped to their waists, squatting
round the low tables, each with his sword, knife, or
‘shotel’ in his hand, some eating, some helping themselves,
and some waiting their turn, but all bearing in
their features the expression of that fierce gluttony
which one attributes more to the lion or leopard than
to the race of Adam. The imagination may be much
assisted by the idea of the lumps of raw pink and blue
flesh they are gloating over. But I have yet to describe
how they eat the strip of meat which I have just made
one of the party cut off. A quantity of ‘dillikh’ or
‘aou-a-zé’ being laid on his bread, he dips one end of
the meat into it, and then, seizing it between his teeth,
while he holds the other end in his left hand, he cuts a
bit off close to his lips by an upward stroke of his sword,
only just avoiding the tip of his nose, and so on till he
has finished the whole strip.’</p>

<p>Australian delicacies are somewhat different to our
own. The flying-fox (<i>Pteropus</i>), an animal of the
bat family, which makes sad havoc at night among the
fruit trees of the colonists, is in return shot down without
mercy. Their flesh is delicate, and they are almost
invariably very fat, but owing to the demoniac appearance
of their black leathery wings, and to the prejudice
which this appearance excites, they are seldom eaten by
the settlers. Travellers in the wilderness, however,
are frequently indebted for a hearty meal to their success
in bringing down these creatures.</p>

<p>The burrowing wombat, or native pig, which feeds
chiefly on roots, is not deemed bad food. When divested
of its fur and tough skin, its flesh, although red and
coarse in appearance, resembles that of a pig in flavour,
and is usually cooked by the colonists like fresh pork
would be. The flesh of the porcupine ant-eater somewhat
resembles that of a young sucking pig, and is
highly esteemed.</p>

<p>There are several other small quadrupeds, including
a burrowing or prairie-rat, which, at particular seasons,
and in certain localities in Australia, constitute the chief
animal food of the natives. The flesh of the little
short-legged bandicoot is very white and delicate.
Cooked like a rabbit, it furnishes the sportsman’s table
with a splendid dish.</p>

<p>Among quadrupeds, besides the ordinary domestic fed
or wild animals commonly eaten as food, we find apes
and monkeys, the spider monkey, the marmozet, bats,
hedgehogs, bears, racoons, badgers, and dogs; many of
the carnivorous animals, as foxes, lions and tigers, the
puma, &amp;c., are also eaten. Then again we have the
seal and the walrus.</p>

<p>African epicures esteem as one of their greatest delicacies
a tender young monkey, highly seasoned and
spiced, and baked in a jar set in the earth, with a fire
over it, in gipsy fashion. Monkeys are commonly sold
with parrots and the paca, in the markets at Rio
Janeiro. The Indians, many negroes, and some whites,
in Trinidad, eat of the flesh of the great red monkey,
and say it is delicious. This, however, seems a semi-cannibal
kind of repast—for it is the most vociferous
and untameable of the Simian tribe.</p>

<p>Several species of monkey are used as food by the
aboriginal inhabitants of the Malayan peninsula. As
all kinds of monkeys are very destructive to his rice
fields, the Dyak of Borneo is equally their enemy; and
as this people esteem their flesh as an article of food,
no opportunity of destroying them is lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Hugh Low says, he once saw some Dyaks
roasting a monkey, but did not stay to observe
whether they did not boil it afterwards, as they generally
partially roast these animals to free them from
the hair.</p>

<p>Monkeys are eaten in Ceylon by some of the natives,
and the Africans on the Gold Coast eat them, according
to the report of Governor Connor, in his Dispatch to the
Colonial Office, March 2, 1857.—<i>Reports on Colonial
Possessions, transmitted with the Blue Book, for the
year 1856.</i></p>

<p>In South America monkeys are ordinarily killed as
game by the natives, for the sake of their flesh; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the appearance of these animals is so revolting to Europeans,
that they can seldom force themselves to partake
of such fare.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace (<i>Travels on the Amazon</i>) says, ‘having
often heard how good monkey was, I had it cut up
and fried for breakfast; the meat somewhat resembled
rabbit, without any peculiar or unpleasant flavour.’ The
manner in which these animals are roasted by the
natives, as described by Humboldt, further contributes
to render their appearance disgusting.</p>

<p>‘A little grating or lattice of very hard wood is
formed, and raised a foot from the ground. The monkey
is skinned, and bent into a sitting posture, the head
generally resting on the arms, which are meagre and
long; but sometimes these are crossed behind the
back. When it is tied on the grating, a very clear fire
is kindled below; the monkey, enveloped in smoke and
flame, is broiled and blackened at the same time.
Roasted monkeys, particularly those that have a round
head, display a hideous resemblance to a child; the
Europeans, therefore, who are obliged to feed on them,
prefer separating the head and hands, and serve only
the rest of the animal at their tables. The flesh of
monkeys is so dry and lean, that M. Bonpland has preserved,
in his collection at Paris, an arm and hand,
which had been broiled over the fire at Esmeralda, and
no smell arises from them after a number of years.’</p>

<p>Sir Robert Schomburgk, in the Journal of his expedition
to the Upper Corentyne, and interior of Guiana,
when suffering the pangs of hunger, reports that at last
their Indian hunter arrived, with heavy step, carrying
on his shoulder a large, black, female spider monkey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>‘I glanced,’ he observes, ‘at Mr. Goodall, whose
countenance depicted disappointment and disgust, but
which sad necessity, and the large vacuum that two
ounces of farinha must have left in his stomach, induced
him to get the better of. He watched the preparations
as the Indians proceeded step by step, first singeing off
the hair from this human-like form, and then placing it
in an upright position, with the arms crossed; when,
the skin looking white now the hair was off, the sight
proved too much for him, and I myself felt something
like disgust at the meal before us. The sound of a
heavy body falling on the ground drew my attention to
a different direction, and to my great joy, I beheld a
fine young forest deer, over which young Ammon stood,
leaning on his gun with proud satisfaction. This was
indeed, a happy turn in our affairs.</p>

<p>‘I have tasted the smaller kind of monkeys several times,
but have never partaken of one which approached so
nearly to the human form as this. The Indians were
less scrupulous.’</p>

<p>The ateles, as well indeed as all other American
quadrumanes, are esteemed as an article of food by the
native Indians; and even Europeans, whom curiosity or
necessity has induced to taste it, report their flesh to be
white, juicy, and agreeable. Nor is it without being
strongly disposed to question the nature of the act,
that European sportsmen, unaccustomed to shooting
monkeys, witness for the first time the dying struggles
of these animals; without uttering a complaint, they
silently watch the blood as it flows from the wound,
from time to time turning their eyes upon the sportsman
with an expression of reproach, which cannot be
misinterpreted. Some travellers even go so far as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
assert that the companions of the wounded individual
will not only assist him to climb beyond the reach of
further danger, but will even chew leaves and apply
them to the wound, for the purpose of stopping the
hemorrhage.</p>

<p>One of the spider monkeys, the marimonda (<i>Ateles
belzebuth</i>, Desm.), is termed <i>aru</i> by the Indians of the
Rio Guiana, and is a favourite article of food with the
natives of the borders of the Cassiquiare, the higher
Orinoco, and other rivers, and its boiled limbs are commonly
to be seen in their huts.</p>

<p>The howling monkeys (<i>Mycetes</i>), which are of
larger size, and fatter than some of the other species,
are in great request with the Indians as food. Mr.
Gosse states that the flavour of their flesh is like that of
kid. The Aturian Indians, as well as those of Esmeralda,
eat many kinds of monkeys at certain seasons of the year,
and especially the couxio, or jacketed monkey (<i>Pithecia
sagulati</i>, Traill).</p>

<p>Mr. Grant in his <i>History of Brazil</i> states, that apes
and monkeys are esteemed good food by the natives.</p>

<p>The negroes and natives of New Granada, according
to Bonnycastle, also eat the monkey.</p>

<p>To prepare this dish, the body is scalded in order to
remove the hair, and after this operation has been performed,
it has the exact appearance of a young dead
child, and is so disgusting, that no one, excepting those
pressed by hunger, could partake of the repast. It is
not at all improbable that many savage nations who
have been accused of cannibalism, have been very unjustly
charged with it, for, according to Ulloa, the appearance
of the monkey of Panama, when ready to be
cooked, is precisely that of a human body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c sp">CHEIROPTERA, OR HAND-WINGED<br>
ANIMALS.</p>

<p>The fox monkey or flying lemur (<i>Galeopithecus
volans</i>) diffuses a rank disagreeable odour, yet the flesh
is eaten by the natives of the islands of the Indian
Archipelago.</p>

<p>The Dutch, when in the island of Mauritius are said to
have been fond of the flesh of bats, preferring it to the
finest game, but I have never heard the opinion corroborated
there by others. The Indians of Malabar and
other parts of the East Indies, are said to eat the flesh
of bats.</p>

<p>The flesh of most bats is eaten in the Eastern Archipelago,
and by some esteemed, being compared to that
of hare or partridge in flavour. The flesh of the
largest and most common, the black-bellied roussette
(<i>Pteropus edulis</i>, Geoff.), has a musky odour, but is
esteemed by the natives. They catch them in bags at
the end of a pole.</p>

<p>Fancy a great frightful animal like a weasel, with
wings two feet in length, being served up at table. Still
they must be palatable, since one species has thus been
named by naturalists, ‘the eatable’ bat. The flesh is
stated to be white, delicate, and remarkably tender, and
is regarded by the inhabitants of Timor as a dainty.
The body is ten inches long, covered with close and
shining black hair, and the extended wings are about
four feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>


<p class="c">CARNIVORA.</p>

<p>Carnivorous animals,—the terrible wild hunters of the
forests and deserts,—are themselves preyed upon by
man.</p>

<p>The low Arabs do not object to the flesh of the
hyena, although the smell of the carcase is so rank and
offensive, that even dogs leave it with disgust, yet their
own voracious kindred obligingly gobble them up.</p>

<p>Even that pestilential animal the pole-cat, or skunk,
falls a prey to the voracity of hungry men. When
care is taken not to soil the carcase with any of the
strong smelling fluid exuded by the animal, the meat is
considered by the natives of North America to be excellent
food. They eat foxes in Italy, where they are
sold dear, and thought fit for the table of a cardinal.
Mr. Kennedy, a recent voyager to the arctic regions,
speaks of the delicacy of a fox pie, which was pronounced
by competent authorities in his mess to be
equal to rabbit; but then he honestly admits, that there
were others to whom it suggested uncomfortable reminiscences
of dead cats, and who generally preferred the
opposite side of the table, when the dish made its appearance.
This repugnance is even shared by the brute
creation, for although Esquimaux dogs may kill a fox,
they will not eat him. This is the more extraordinary,
as they are the most voracious and dirty-feeding animals
known; nothing they can possibly get at being safe.
Buffalo robes, seal skins, their own harness, even boots,
shoes, clothes, and dish cloths are sure to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The prairie wolf is eaten by the Indians of North
America. The flesh of the sloth is devoured with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
great avidity by the natives of Demerara; and that of
the lion by the Hottentots, while a tribe of Arabs
between Tunis and Algeria, according to Blumenbach,
live almost entirely upon its flesh.</p>

<p>The natives of the Malay Peninsula eat the flesh of
the tiger, believing it to be a sovereign specific for all
diseases, besides imparting to him who partakes of it
the courage and sagacity of the animal.</p>

<p>Some people have ventured to eat the <i>cujuacura</i> or
American panther, and say it is very delicate food; and
the flesh of the wild cat of Louisiana is said to be good
to eat.</p>

<p>The flesh of the cougar or puma (<i>Felis concolor</i>), a
fierce carnivorous animal, is eaten in Central America,
and is said to be agreeable food. The injunction of St.
Paul, ‘to eat what is set before us, and ask no questions
for conscience sake,’ would hardly be a safe maxim in
Central America, at an entertainment given ‘under the
greenwood tree’ by the ‘Ancient Foresters’ of Honduras.
The sylvan dainties would not be composed
of precisely the same materials as a <i>petit diné</i> at the
<i>Trois Frères</i>, or the <i>Café de Paris</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, in his <i>Journal of a Naturalist</i>, tells us
that ‘once at supper, from something which was said, I
was suddenly struck with horror at thinking I was eating
one of the favourite dishes of the country, namely, a
half formed calf, long before its proper time of birth.
It turned out to be puma; the meat is very white, and
remarkably like veal in taste. Dr. Shaw was laughed
at for stating that the flesh of the lion is in great
esteem, having no small affinity with veal, both in
colour, taste, and flavour. Such certainly is the case
with the puma. The Gauchos differ in their opinion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
whether the jaguar is good eating, but are unanimous
in saying that cat is excellent.’</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace, when travelling up the Amazon, writes—‘Several
jaguars were killed, as Mr. C— pays about
8s. each for their skins. One day we had some steaks at
the table, and found the meat very white and without
any bad taste. It appears evident to me that the common
idea of the food of an animal determining the
quality of its meat, is quite erroneous. Domestic
poultry and pigs are the most unclean animals in their
food, yet their flesh is most highly esteemed, while rats
and squirrels, which eat only vegetable food, are in
general disrepute. Carnivorous fish are not less delicate
eating than herbivorous ones, and there appears no
reason why some carnivorous animals should not furnish
wholesome and palatable food.’</p>

<p>Bears’ paws were long reckoned a great delicacy
in Germany, for some authors tell us, that after being
salted and smoked, they were reserved for the tables of
princes. In North America, bears’ flesh was formerly
considered equal to pork, the meat having a flavour
between beef and pork; and the young cubs were accounted
the finest eating in the world. Dr. Brooke, in
his <i>Natural History</i>, adds—‘Most of the planters prefer
bears’ flesh to beef, veal, pork, and mutton. The fat is as
white as snow, and extremely sweet and wholesome, for
if a man drinks a quart of it at a time, when melted, it
will never rise on his stomach! It is of very great use
for the frying of fish and other things, and is greatly
preferred to butter.’</p>

<p>Tastes have naturally altered since this was written,
nearly a century ago, and it would be somewhat difficult
to carry on the sport of bear hunting on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
extensive scale then practised, when we are told 500
bears were killed in two of the counties in Virginia in
one winter.</p>

<p>The Indians seem to have shared largely in the
sport and spoils of the chase, for at their subsequent
feast, the largest bear was served up as the first course,
and they ‘roasted him whole, entrails, skin and all, in
the same manner as they would barbecue a hog.’</p>

<p>As the paws of the bear were held to be the most
delicious morsels about him, so the head was thought
to be the worst, and always thrown away; but the
tongue and hams are still in repute.</p>

<p>The white bear is eaten by the Esquimaux and the
Danes of Greenland; and when young, and cooked
after the manner of beef steaks, is by no means to be
despised, although rather insipid; the fat, however,
ought to be avoided, as unpleasant to the palate.</p>

<p>The flesh of the badger (<i>Taxus vulgaris</i>, Desm.) is
said to be good eating, and to taste like that of a boar.
The omnivorous and thrifty Chinese eat it, as indeed
they do that of the flesh of most animals, and consider
its hams a very great dainty.</p>

<p>Many nations consider the flesh of the dog excellent.
The Greeks ate it; and Hippocrates was convinced that
it was a light and wholesome food. The common
people of Rome also ate it. The Turks and some of
the Asiatic citizens would thank any one who would
rid the thoroughfares of the tribes of dogs which
infest the streets and courts; and there is a reward
given for their slaughter. Fine feasts might be made
of them by those who liked them, while the skins would
come in for dog-skin gloves. Many of the South Sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
islanders fatten dogs for eating, but these live wholly
on vegetable food.</p>

<p>The domestic dog of China is uniformly one variety,
about the size of a moderate spaniel, of a pale yellow,
and occasionally a black colour, with coarse bristly hair
on the back, sharp upright ears, and peaked head,
not unlike a fox’s, with a tail curled over the rump.</p>

<p>In China, the dog is fattened for the table, and the
flesh of dogs is as much liked by them as mutton is by
us; being exposed for sale by their butchers, and in
their cook-shops.</p>

<p>At Canton, the hind quarters of dogs are seen hanging
up in the most prominent parts of the shops
exposed for sale. They are considered by the Chinese
as a most dainty food, and are consumed by both rich
and poor.</p>

<p>The breeds common in that country are apparently
peculiar to itself, and they are objects of more attention
to their owners than elsewhere in Asia. The Celestials,
perhaps, having an eye to their tender haunches, which
bad treatment would toughen and spoil.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Africans of Zanzibar hold a stew of puppies,
as amongst us in the days of Charles the Second, as a
dish fit for a monarch.</p>

<p>The Australian native dog or dingo, in aspect and
colour resembling a fox, is hunted down by the colonists
owing to its depredations among the flocks. The
flesh even of this animal is eaten by the blacks. The
aborigines are often driven for subsistence to the most
wretched food, as snakes and other reptiles, grubs,
lizards, and the larvæ of the white ant. When they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
do obtain better food, they prepare it with more care
than might be expected. In cooking fish, they wrap
it in soft bark and place it in hot ashes. By this process
an acid from the bark is communicated to the fish,
which gives it a most agreeable flavour.</p>

<p>A traveller in the Sandwich Islands, relating his
experience, says,—‘Near every place at table was a
fine young dog, the flesh of which was declared to be
excellent by all who partook of it. To my palate its
taste was what I can imagine would result from mingling
the flavour of pig and lamb; and I did not hesitate
to make my dinner of it, in spite of some qualms at the
first mouthful. I must confess, when I reflected that
the puppy now trussed up before us, might have been
the affectionate and frolicsome companion of some Hawaiian
fair—they all have pet pigs or puppies—I felt
as if dog-eating were only a low grade of cannibalism.
What eat poor Ponto?—</p>

<p>‘However, the edible dog is not one of your common
curs, but a dainty animal, fed exclusively on vegetables,
chiefly taro (a root), in the form of poë (dough), and
at the age of two years is considered a dish wherewith
to regale royalty. Indeed, the Sandwich Island monarch,
I suspect, would be always well satisfied to see it
before him, in spite of the assertion of Dr. Kidd, that
‘it is worthy of consideration that the flesh of those
animals, of whose living services we stand hourly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
need, as the <i>horse</i> and the <i>dog</i>, are so unpalatable, that
we are not tempted to eat them unless in cases of dreadful
necessity.’ The doctor probably never assisted at a native
luaü or feast, or associated with the trappers upon
the prairies of the Far West.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Mr. John Dunn, in his <i>History of the Oregon Territory</i>,
tells a story of a Canadian cook, who, wishing
to do honour to a dear and respected friend, whom he
had been dining with on board his ship, studied long
what he could get good enough to set before him, and
at last bethought him of dog, which is, or was, a favourite
dish among Canadian voyageurs or boatmen.</p>

<p>At the banquet the old boatswain ate heartily of it, as
did the cook. After he had done, the cook enquired how
he had enjoyed his dinner. He said it was beautiful. He
then asked him whether he knew what he had been
dining on? He said he supposed from a goat.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ says the cook, ‘you have been eating from a
goat with von long tail, that don’t like grass or heather.’</p>

<p>‘How is that?’ inquired the boatswain.</p>

<p>‘Vy you see,’ replied the cook, ‘it was my best dog
you have dined from.’</p>

<p>The old boatswain stormed and swore; and then ran
as fast as possible to the vessel to get a little rum for
his stomach. He vowed that he never again wished to
dine with a Canadian cook, or eat pet dogs.</p>

<p>Brooke, in his <i>Natural History of Quadrupeds</i>,
tells us, that ‘in the southern coast of Africa, there
are dogs that neither bark nor bite like ours, and they
are of all kinds of colours. Their flesh is eaten by the
negroes, who are very fond of all sorts of dogs’ flesh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and will give one of their country cows for a large
mastiff. I do not know what part of Africa this refers
to.</p>

<p>In old medical works we are told, that the flesh of a
fox, either boiled or roasted, was said to be good for
consumption; but I do not think it is often prescribed
or used for that purpose now.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c sp">MARSUPIALIA, OR POUCHED ANIMALS.</p>

<p>The kangaroo is <i>par excellence</i> the wild game of
Australia, and coursing it gives active employment to
its pursuers. The flesh of all the several species is
good. The fore-quarters, indeed, of the forester, the
largest of the family, an animal which frequently
weighs 200 lbs., are somewhat inferior, and are usually
given to the dogs; but from the hind-quarters some
fine steaks may be cut. When cooked in the same
manner, they are very little inferior to venison collops.</p>

<p>The brush kangaroo (<i>Macropus cœruleus</i>) is a very
fleet active animal, sometimes of about 20 lbs. weight,
having fur of a silver grey colour, with a white stripe
on each side of its face.</p>

<p>The flesh of the larger kangaroo, as well as that of
the wallaby, a smaller animal, averaging about 12 or
14 lbs., is often hashed, and with a little seasoning and
skill in preparation, it is excellent. The wallaby is
commonly stewed for soup.</p>

<p>The best part of the kangaroo is its tail. Talk of
ox-tail soup, ye metropolitan gourmands! Commend
us to the superb kangaroo-tail soup of Australia, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
from the tail weighing some 10 or 12 lbs., if a full-grown
forester.</p>

<p>The pademelon, a smaller species of kangaroo, weighs
about 9 or 10 lbs., and when cooked like a hare,
affords a dish with which the most fastidious gourmand
might be satisfied.</p>

<p>The following is the native mode of cooking a kangaroo
steak:—It is placed in a scooped out stone,
which is readily found in the streams, and pressed
down by heavy stones on the top of it; the heat is
applied beneath and round the first top stone; at the
critical moment the stones are quickly removed, and
the steak appears in its most savoury state.</p>

<p>The aborigines of Australia always roast their food;
they have no means of boiling, except when they procure
the service of an old European saucepan or tin pot.
‘It is a very remarkable fact’ (remarks Mr. Moore) ‘in the
history of mankind, that a people should be found now
to exist, without any means of heating water, or cooking
liquid food; or, in short, without any culinary
utensil or device of any sort. The only mode of cooking
was to put the food into the fire, or roast it in the embers
or hot ashes; small fish or frogs being sometimes
first wrapped in a piece of paper-tree bark. Such was
their state when Europeans first came among them.
They are now extremely fond of soup and tea.’</p>

<p>A native will not eat tainted meat, although he cannot
be said to be very nice in his food, according to our
ideas. Their meat is cooked almost as soon as killed,
and eaten immediately.</p>

<p>The parts of the kangaroo most esteemed for eating
are the loins and the tail, which abound in gelatine,
and furnish an excellent and nourishing soup; the hind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
legs are coarse, and usually fall to the share of the
dogs. The natives (if they can be said to have a choice)
give a preference to the head. The flesh of the full-grown
animal may be compared to lean beef, and that
of the young to veal; they are destitute of fat, if we
except a little being occasionally seen between the
muscles and integuments of the tail. The colonial
dish, called a <i>steamer</i>, consists of the flesh of the animal
dressed, with slices of ham. The liver when cooked
is crisp and dry, and is considered a substitute for
bread; but I cannot coincide in this opinion.</p>

<p>The goto, or long bag of kangaroo skin, about two
feet deep, and a foot and a half broad, carried by the
native females in Australia, is the common receptacle
for every small article which the wife or husband may
require or take a fancy to, whatever its nature or condition
may be. Fish just caught, or dry bread, frogs,
roots, and clay, are all mingled together.</p>

<p>Mr. George Bennett (<i>Wanderings in New South
Wales</i>) thus speaks of Australian native cookery:—</p>

<p>‘After wet weather they track game with much facility;
and from the late rains the hunting expeditions
had been very successful; game was, therefore, very
abundant at the camp, which consisted of opossums,
flying squirrels, bandicoots, snakes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘One of the opossums among the game was a female,
which had two large-sized young ones in her pouch;
these delicate morsels were at this time broiling, unskinned
and undrawn, upon the fire, whilst the old
mother was lying yet unflayed in the basket.</p>

<p>‘It was amusing to see with what rapidity and expertness
the animals were skinned and embowelled by
the blacks. The offal was thrown to the dogs; but, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
such a waste on the part of the natives does not often
take place, we can only presume it is when game, as it
was at present, is very abundant. The dogs are usually
in poor condition, from getting a very precarious
supply of provender. The liver being extracted, and
gall-bladder removed, a stick was thrust through the
animal, which was either thrown upon the ashes to
broil, or placed upon a wooden spit before the fire to
roast. Whether the food was removed from the fire
cooked, or only half dressed, depended entirely on the
state of their appetites. The flesh of the animals at
this time preparing for dinner, by our tawny friends,
appeared delicate, and was no doubt excellent eating,
as the diet of the animals was in most instances vegetable.’</p>

<p>Another traveller in the Bush thus describes the
aboriginal practices and food:—‘We had scarcely
finished the snake, when Tomboor-rowa and little
Sydney returned again. They had been more successful
this time, having shot two wallabies or brush kangaroos
and another carpet-snake of six feet in length.
A bundle of rotten branches was instantly gathered and
thrown upon the expiring embers of our former fire, and
both the wallabies and the snake were thrown into the
flame. One of the wallabies had been a female, and as
it lay dead on the grass, a young one, four or five inches
long, crept out of its pouch. I took up the little creature,
and, presenting it to the pouch, it crept in again.
Having turned round, however, for a minute or two,
Gnunnumbah had taken it up and thrown it alive into
the fire; for, when I happened to look towards the
fire, I saw it in the flames in the agony of death. In
a minute or two the young wallaby being sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
done, Gnunnumbah drew it out of the fire with a stick,
and eat its hind-quarters without further preparation,
throwing the rest of it away.</p>

<p>‘It is the etiquette among the black natives for the
person who takes the game to conduct the cooking of it.
As soon, therefore, as the skins of the wallabies had
become stiff and distended from the expansion of the
gases in the cavity of their bodies, Tomboor-rowa and
Sydney each pulled one of them from the fire, and
scraping off the singed hair roughly with the hand, cut
up the belly and pulled out the entrails. They then
cleaned out the entrails, not very carefully by any
means, rubbing them roughly on the grass or on the
bushes, and then threw them again upon the fire.
When they considered them sufficiently done, the two
eat them, a considerable quantity of their original contents
remaining to serve as a sort of condiment or
sauce. The tails and lower limbs of the two wallabies,
when the latter were supposed to be done enough,
were twisted off and eaten by the other two natives
(from one of whom I got one of the vertebræ of the
tail and found it delicious); the rest of the carcases,
with the large snake, being packed up in a number of
the <i>Sydney Herald</i>, to serve as a mess for the whole
camp at Brisbane. The black fellows were evidently
quite delighted with the excursion; and, on our return
to the Settlement, they asked Mr. Wade if he was not
going again to-morrow.’</p>

<p>The kangaroo rat, an animal nearly as large as a
wild rabbit, is tolerably abundant, and very good eating,
when cooked in the same manner. The natives
take them by driving a spear into the nest, sometimes
transfixing two at once, or by jumping upon the nest,
which is formed of leaves and grass upon the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>It is less sought for than its larger relatives,
except by thorough bushmen, owing to the prejudice
excited by the unfortunate name which has been bestowed
upon it. Those who have once tried it usually
become fond of it; and to the sawyers and splitters
these animals yield many a fresh meal, during their
sojourn amidst the heavily timbered flats and ranges of
Victoria and New South Wales. The animal is not of
the rat species, but a perfect kangaroo in miniature.</p>

<p>The flesh of the phalangers is of delicate flavor.
The large grey opossum (<i>Phalangista vulpina</i>) forms
a great resource for food to the natives of Australia,
who climb the tallest trees in search of them, and take
them from the hollow branches. The flesh is very good,
though not much used by the settlers, the carcase being
thrown to the dogs, while the sportsman contents himself
with the skin.</p>

<p>The common opossum (<i>Didelphys Virginiana</i>) is
eaten in some of the states and territories of America;
it is very much like a large rat, and is classed among
the ‘vermin’ by the Americans. Their flesh is, however,
white and well-tasted; but their ugly tail puts
one out of conceit with the fare.</p>

<p>The wombat, a bear-like marsupial quadruped of
Australia, (the <i>Phascolomys wombat</i>,) is eaten in
New South Wales and other parts of the Australian
Continent. In size it often equals a sheep, some of the
largest weighing 140 lbs.; and the flesh is said by
some to be not unlike venison, and by others to resemble
lean mutton. As it is of such considerable size,
attaining the length of three feet, it has been suggested
that it might be worth naturalizing here.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>


<p class="c">RODENTIA.</p>

<p>Passing now to the rodents or gnawing animals, we
find that the large grey squirrel (<i>Sciurus cinereus</i>,
Desm.) is very good eating. The flesh of the squirrel
is much valued by the Dyaks, and it will, doubtless,
hereafter be prized for the table of Europeans.</p>

<p>The marmot (<i>Arctomys Marmotta</i>), in its fat state,
when it first retires to its winter quarters, is in very
good condition, and is then killed and eaten in great
numbers, although we may affect to despise it.</p>

<p>The mouse, to the Esquimaux epicures, is a real <i>bonne
bouche</i>, and if they can catch half-a-dozen at a time,
they run a piece of horn or twig through them, in the
same manner as the London poulterers prepare larks
for the table; and without stopping to skin them, or divest
them of their entrails, broil them over the fire; and
although some of the mice may have belonged to the
aborigines of the race, yet so strong is the mastication
of the natives, that the bones of the animal yield to its
power as easily as the bones of a rabbit would to a shark.</p>

<p>There is a very large species of rat spoken of as found
in the island of Martinique, nearly four times the size of
the ordinary rat. It is black on the back, with a white
belly, and is called, locally, the piloris or musk rat, as it
perfumes the air around. The inhabitants eat them; but
then they are obliged, after they are skinned, to expose
them a whole night to the air; and they likewise throw
away the first water they are boiled in, because it smells
so strongly of musk.</p>

<p>The flesh of the musk rat is not bad, except in rutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
time, for then it is impossible to deprive it of the musky
smell and flavour.</p>

<p>So fat and sleek do the rats become in the West
Indies, from feeding on the sugar cane in the cane fields,
that some of the negroes find them an object of value,
and, with the addition of peppers and similar spiceries,
prepare from them a delicate fricassée not to be surpassed
by a dish of French frogs.</p>

<p>There is a professional rat-catcher employed on each
sugar plantation, and he is paid so much a dozen for
the tails he brings in to the overseer. Father Labat
tells us that he made his hunters bring the whole rat to
him, for if the heads or tails only came, the bodies were
eaten by the negroes, which he wished to prevent, as
he thought that this food brought on consumption!
The health of the negroes was then a matter of moment,
considering the money value at which they were estimated
and sold. A rat hunt in a cane field affords
glorious sport. In cutting down the canes, one small
patch is reserved standing, into which all the rats congregate,
and the negroes, surrounding the preserve, with
their clubs and bill-hooks speedily despatch the rats,
and many are soon skinned and cooked.</p>

<p>The negroes in Brazil, too, eat every rat which they
can catch; and I do not see why they should not be well-tasted
and wholesome meat, seeing that their food is entirely
vegetable, and that they are clean, sleek, and
plump. The Australian aborigines eat mice and rats
whenever they can catch them.</p>

<p>Scinde is so infested with rats, that the price of grain
has risen 25 per cent. from the destruction caused to the
standing crops by them. The government commissioner
has recently issued a proclamation granting head-money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
on all rats and mice killed in the province. The
rate is to be 3<i>d.</i> a dozen, the slayer having the privilege
of keeping the body and presenting the tail.</p>

<p>In China, rat soup is considered equal to ox-tail soup,
and a dozen fine rats will realize two dollars, or eight
or nine shillings.</p>

<p>Besides the attractions of the gold-fields for the Chinese,
California is so abundantly supplied with rats, that
they can live like Celestial emperors, and pay very little
for their board. The rats of California exceed the rats
of the older American States, just as nature on that
side of the continent exceeds in bountifulness of mineral
wealth. The California rats are incredibly large, highly
flavoured, and very abundant. The most refined
Chinese in California have no hesitation in publicly expressing
their opinion of ‘them rats.’ Their professed
cooks, we are told, serve up rats’ brains in a much superior
style to the Roman dish of nightingales’ and peacocks’
tongues. The sauce used is garlic, aromatic
seeds, and camphor.</p>

<p>Chinese dishes and Chinese cooking have lately been
popularly described by the fluent pen of Mr. Wingrove
Cooke, the <i>Times’</i> correspondent in China, but he has
by no means exhausted the subject. Chinese eating
saloons have been opened in California and Australia,
for the accommodation of the Celestials who now throng
the gold-diggings, despite the heavy poll-tax to which
they have been subjected.</p>

<p>Mr. Albert Smith, writing home from China, August
22, 1858, his first impressions, says:—</p>

<p>‘The filth they eat in the eating houses far surpasses
that cooked at that old <i>trattoria</i> at Genoa. It consists
for the most part of rats, bats, snails, bad eggs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
hideous fish, dried in the most frightful attitudes. Some
of the <i>restaurateurs</i> carry their cook-shops about with
them on long poles, with the kitchen at one end, and
the <i>salle-à-manger</i> at the other. These are celebrated
for a soup made, I should think, from large caterpillars
boiled in a thin gravy, with onions.’</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the bill of fare of
one of the San Francisco eating houses—</p>

<p>The latter dish is rather dubious. What is meant by
stews <i>rat</i>-ified? Can it be another name for rat pie?
Give us light, but no pie.</p>

<p>The San Francisco <i>Whig</i> furnishes the following description
of a Chinese feast in that city:—‘We were
yesterday invited, with three other gentlemen, to partake
of a dinner <i>à la</i> Chinese. At three o’clock we were waited
upon by our hosts, Keychong, and his partner in Sacramento-street,
Peter Anderson, now a naturalized citizen
of the United States, and Acou, and escorted to the
crack Chinese restaurant in Dupont-street, called Hong-fo-la,
where a circular table was set out in fine style:—</p>

<p>‘Course No. 1.—Tea, hung-yos (burnt almonds), ton-kens
(dry ginger), sung-wos (preserved orange).</p>

<p>‘Course No 2.—Won-fo (a dish oblivious to us, and
not mentioned in the cookery-book).</p>

<p>‘No. 3.—Ton-song (ditto likewise).</p>

<p>‘No. 4.—Tap-fau (another <i>quien sabe</i>).</p>

<p>‘No. 5.—Ko-yo (a conglomerate of fish, flesh, and fowl).</p>

<p>‘No. 6.—Suei-chon (a species of fish ball).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>‘Here a kind of liquor was introduced, served up in
small cups, holding about a thimbleful, which politeness
required we should empty between every course,
first touching cups and salaaming.</p>

<p>‘No. 7.—Beche-le-mer (a dried sea-slug, resembling
India rubber, worth one dollar per pound).</p>

<p>‘No. 8—Moisum. (Have some?)</p>

<p>‘No. 9.—Su-Yum (small balls, as bills of lading remark,
‘contents unknown’).</p>

<p>‘No. 10.—Hoisuigo (a kind of dried oyster).</p>

<p>‘No. 11.—Songhai (China lobster).</p>

<p>‘No. 12.—Chung-so (small ducks in oil).</p>

<p>‘No. 13.—Tong-chou (mushrooms, worth three dollars
per pound).</p>

<p>‘No. 14.—Sum-yoi (birds’ nests, worth 60 dollars
per pound).</p>

<p>‘And some ten or twelve more courses, consisting of
stewed acorns, chestnuts, sausages, dried ducks, stuffed
oysters, shrimps, periwinkles, and ending with tea—each
course being served up with small china bowls and
plates, in the handiest and neatest manner; and we
have dined in many a crack restaurant, where it would
be a decided improvement to copy from our Chinese
friends. The most difficult feat for us was the handling
of the chop sticks, which mode of carrying to the mouth
is a practical illustration of the old proverb, ‘many a
slip ’twixt the cup and lip.’ We came away, after a
three hours’ sitting, fully convinced that a China dinner
is a very costly and elaborate affair, worthy the attention
of epicures. From this time, henceforth, we are in
the field for China, against any insinuations on the
question of diet <i>à la</i> rat, which we pronounce a tale of
untruth. We beg leave to return thanks to our host,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Keychong, for his elegant entertainment, which one
conversant with the Chinese bill of fare informs us, must
have cost over 100 dollars. <i>Vive la China!</i>’</p>

<p>Mr. Cooke, in his graphic letters from China, speaks
of the fatness and fertility of the rats of our colony of
Hong Kong. He adds: ‘When Minutius, the dictator,
was swearing Flaminius in as his Master of the Horse, we
are told by Plutarch that a rat chanced to squeak, and
the superstitious people compelled both officers to resign
their posts. Office would be held with great uncertainty
in Hong Kong if a similar superstition prevailed.
Sir John Bowring has just been swearing in General
Ashburnham as member of the Colonial Council, and if
the rats were silent, they showed unusual modesty.
They have forced themselves, however, into a state
paper. Two hundred rats are destroyed every night in
the gaol. Each morning the Chinese prisoners see,
with tearful eyes and watering mouths, a pile of these
delicacies cast out in waste. It is as if Christian
prisoners were to see scores of white sucking pigs tossed
forth to the dogs by Mahommedan gaolers. At last
they could refrain no longer. Daring the punishment
of tail-cutting, which follows any infraction of prison
discipline, they first attempted to abstract the delicacies.
Foiled in this, they took the more manly course. They
indited a petition in good Chinese, proving from Confucius
that it is sinful to cast away the food of man, and
praying that the meat might be handed over to them to
cook and eat. This is a fact, and if General Thompson
doubts it, I recommend him to move for a copy of the
correspondence.’</p>

<p>A new article of traffic is about to be introduced into
the China market from India, namely, <i>salted rats</i>!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
The genius with whom the idea originated, it would appear,
is sanguine; so much so, that he considers himself
‘on the fair road to fortune.’ The speculation deserves
success, if for nothing else than its originality. I have
not, as yet however, observed the price that rules in
Whampoa and Hong Kong nor the commodity quoted in
any of the merchants’ circulars, though it will, doubtless,
soon find its place in them as a regular article of import.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Calcutta Citizen</i>, writing from
Kurrachee, the chief town of the before mentioned rat
infested province of Scinde, declares that he is determined
to export 120,000 salted rats to China. The
Chinese eat rats, and he thinks they may sell. He
says:—‘I have to pay one pice a dozen, and the gutting,
salting, pressing, and packing in casks, raises the
price to six pice a dozen (about three farthings), and if
I succeed in obtaining anything like the price that rules
in Whampoa and Canton for corn-grown rats, my fortune
is made, or rather, I will be on the fair road to it,
and will open a fine field of enterprise to Scinde.’</p>

<p>Rats may enter into consumption in other quarters,
and among other people, than those named, when we
find such an advertisement as the following in a recent
daily paper at Sydney:—</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap large">Rats! Rats! Rats!</span>—To-night at 8 o’clock, rattling
sport; 200 rats to be entered at G. W. Parker’s
Family Hotel.’</p>

<p>Query.—What ultimately becomes of these rats, and
who are the persons who locate and take their meals at
this ‘Family Hotel?’ Probably they are of the rough
lot whose stomachs are remarkably strong.</p>

<p>Some classes of the Malabars are very fond of the
bandicoot, or pig rat (<i>Perameles nasuta</i>, Geoff. Desm.),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
which measures about fourteen inches in length from
head to tail, the tail being nearly as long as the body.
They are much sought after by the coolies, on the
coffee estates in Ceylon, who eat them roasted. They
also eat the coffee rat (<i>Golunda Ellioti</i> of Gray),
roasted or fried in oil, which is much smaller, the head
and body only measuring about four or five inches.
These animals are migratory, and commit great damages
on the coffee tree, as many as a thousand having been
killed in a day on one estate. The planters offer a reward
for the destruction of these rodents, which brings
grist to the mill in two ways to the coolies who hunt or
entrap them, namely, in money and food.</p>

<p>The fat dormouse (<i>Myoxus glis</i>, Desm.) is used for
food in Italy, as it was by the ancient Romans, who
fattened them for the table in receptacles called Gliraria.</p>

<p>Dr. Rae, in his last arctic exploring expedition, states,
that the principal food of his party was geese, partridges,
and lemmings (<i>Arvicola Hudsonia</i>). These little animals
were migrating northward, and were so numerous that
their dogs, as they trotted on, killed as many as supported
them all, without any other food.</p>

<p>There is another singular little animal, termed by
naturalists the vaulting rat, or jerboa. On an Australian
species, the <i>Dipus Mitchelli</i>, the natives of the
country between Lake Torrens and the Great Creek,
in Australia seem chiefly to subsist. It is a little
larger than a mouse, and the hind legs are similar to
those of the kangaroo.</p>

<p>Captain Sturt and his exploring party once witnessed
a curious scene. They came to a native who had been
eating jerboas, and after they met him they saw him eat
one hundred of them. His mode of cooking was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
unique. He placed a quantity, for a few seconds,
under the ashes of the fire, and then, with the hair only
partially burnt off, took them by the tail, put the body
in his mouth, and bit the tail off with his teeth. After
he had eaten a dozen bodies, he took the dozen tails,
and stuffed them into his mouth.</p>

<p>The flesh of the beaver is looked upon as very delicate
food by the North American hunters, but the tail is
the choicest dainty, and in great request. It is much
prized by the Indians and trappers, especially when it
is roasted in the skin, after the hair has been singed off;
and in some districts it requires all the influence of the
fur-traders to restrain the hunters from sacrificing a
considerable quantity of beaver fur every year to secure
the enjoyment of this luxury. The Indians of
note have generally one or two feasts in a season,
wherein a roasted beaver is the prime dish. It
resembles pork in its flavour, but it requires a strong
stomach to sustain a full meal of it. The flesh is always
in high estimation, except when they have fed upon the
fleshy root of a large water lily, which imparts a rank
taste to it.</p>

<p>The flesh of a young porcupine is said to be excellent
eating, and very nutritious. The flavour is something
between pork and fowl. To be cooked properly, it
should be boiled first, and afterwards roasted. This is
necessary to soften the thick, gristly skin, which is the
best part of the animal. The flesh of the porcupine is
said to be used by the Italians as a stimulant; but,
never having tasted it myself, I cannot speak from experience
as to the virtue of this kind of food.</p>

<p>The Dutch and the Hottentots are very fond of
it; and when skinned and embowelled, the body will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
sometimes weigh 20 lbs. The flesh is said to eat better
when it has been hung in the smoke of a chimney for a
couple of days.</p>

<p>The flesh of the crested porcupine (<i>Hystrix cristata</i>)
is good and very agreeable eating. Some of the Hudson
Bay trappers used to depend upon the <i>Hystrix dorsata</i>
for food at some seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Rabbits, which form so large an article of consumption
with us, are not much esteemed as an article
of food by the negroes in the West Indies, resembling,
in their idea, the cat. Thus, a black who is solicited to
buy a rabbit by an itinerant vendor, would indignantly
exclaim, ‘Rabbit? I should just like to no war you
take me for, ma’am? You tink me go buy rabbit?
No, ma’am, me no cum to dat yet; for me always did
say, an me always will say, dat dem who eat rabbit eat
pussy, an dem who eat pussy eat rabbit. Get out wid
you, and your rabbit?’</p>

<p>And yet, with all this mighty indignation against
rabbits, they do not object, as we have seen, to a less
dainty animal in the shape of the rat.</p>

<p>Although the negroes in the West Indies do not care
for rabbits, yet their brethren in the American States
are by no means averse to them. A field slave one day
found a plump rabbit in his trap. He took him out
alive, held him under his arm, patted him, and began to
speculate on his qualities. ‘Oh, how fat. Berry fat.
The fattest I eber did see. Let me see how I’ll cook
him. I’ll broil him. No, he is so fat he lose all de
grease. I fry him. Ah yes. He so berry fat he fry
hisself. Golly, how fat he be. No, I won’t fry him—I
stew him.’ The thought of the savory stew made
the negro forget himself, and in spreading out the feast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
in his imagination, his arms relaxed, when off hopped
the rabbit, and squatting at a goodly distance, he eyed
his late owner with cool composure. The negro knew
there was an end of the stew, and summoning up all his
philosophy, he thus addressed the rabbit, at the same
time shaking his fist at him, ‘You long-eared, white-whiskered
rascal, you not so berry fat arter all.’</p>

<p>I need not here touch upon hare soup, jugged hare,
or roasted hare, from the flesh of our own rodent; but
the Arctic hare (<i>Lepus glacialis</i>) differs considerably
from the English in the colour and quality of its flesh,
being less dry, whiter, and more delicately tasted; it
may be dressed in any way. When in good condition
it weighs upwards of 10 lbs.</p>

<p>The capybara, or water hog (<i>Hydrochœrus capybara</i>),
an ugly-looking, tailless rodent, the largest of the
family, is hunted for its flesh in South America, and
is said to be remarkably good eating. It grows to the
size of a hog two years old.</p>

<p>The flesh of the guinea pig (<i>Cavia cobaya</i>, Desm.)
is eaten in South America, and is said to be not unlike
pork. When he is dressed for the table his skin is
not taken off as in other animals, but the hair is
scalded and scraped off in the same manner as it is
in a hog.</p>

<p>The white and tender flesh of the agouti (<i>Dasyprocta
Acuti</i>, Desm.), when fat and well dressed, is by
no means unpalatable food, but very delicate and
digestible. It is met with in Brazil, Guiana, and
in Trinidad. The manner of dressing them in the
West Indies used to be to roast them with a pudding
in their bellies. Their skin is white, as well as the
flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The flesh of the brown paca (<i>Cœlogenus subniger</i>,
Desm.), a nearly allied animal, is generally very fat,
and also accounted a great delicacy in Brazil.</p>

<p>Another South American rodent, the bizcacha, or
viscascha (<i>Lagostomus trichodactylus</i>), is eaten for food.
It somewhat resembles a rabbit, but has larger gnawing
teeth, and a long tail. The flesh, when cooked, is
very white and good.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c sp">EDENTATA, OR TOOTHLESS ANIMALS.</p>

<p>Wallace, in his travels on the Amazon, tells us that
the Indians stewed a sloth for their dinner, and as they
considered the meat a great delicacy, he tasted it, and
found it tender and very palatable.</p>

<p>Among other extraordinary animals for which Australia
is proverbial, is the <i>Echidna hystrix</i>, or native
porcupine, which is eaten by the aborigines, who
declare it to be ‘cobbong budgeree (very good), and,
like pig, very fat.’ Europeans who have eaten of them
confirm this opinion, and observe that they taste similar
to a sucking pig. There appear to be two species of
this animal, the spiny echidna and the bristly echidna;
the first attains a large size, equalling the ordinary
hedgehog. It has the external coating and general appearance
of the porcupine, with the mouth and peculiar
generic character of the ant-eater.</p>

<p>The flesh of the great ant-eater (<i>Myrmecophaga
jubata</i>, Linn.) is esteemed a delicacy by the Indians
and negro slaves in Brazil, and, though black and of a
strong musky flavour, is sometimes even met with at
the tables of Europeans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The armadillo, remarkable for its laminated shell,
when baked in its scaly coat is a good treat, the flesh
being considered delicate eating, somewhat like a rabbit
in taste and colour. The flesh of the large twelve-banded
Brazilian one (<i>Dasypus Tatouay</i>) is said to be
the best of all. In South America there are several
species of armadillo, all of which are used for food
when met with.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse states, that this animal feeds upon soft
ground fruits and roots, and also on carrion, whenever
it can find it; and a large proportion of the sustenance
of this, as well as of other species, is derived from the
numberless wild cattle which are caught and slaughtered
on the Pampas for the sake of their hides and
tallow, the carcases being left as valueless to decay, or
to become the prey of wild animals. Notwithstanding
the filthy nature of their food, the armadillos, being
very fat, are eagerly sought for by the inhabitants of
European descent, as well as by the Indians. The
animal is roasted in its shell, and is esteemed one of
the greatest delicacies of the country; the flesh is said
to resemble that of a sucking pig.</p>

<p>What do our African brethren consider tit-bits?
Ask Gordon Cumming. He will enumerate a list longer
than you can remember. Study his ‘Adventures,’ and
you will become learned in the mystery of African culinary
operations. What are sheep’s-trotters and insipid
boiled calves’ feet compared to baked elephants’ paws?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Listen to his description of the whole art and mystery
of the process of preparing them:—</p>

<p>‘The four feet are amputated at the fetlock joint, and
the trunk, which at the base is about two feet in thickness,
is cut into convenient lengths. Trunk and feet
are then baked, preparatory to their removal to headquarters.
The manner in which this is done is as
follows:—A party, provided with sharp-pointed sticks,
dig a hole in the ground for each foot and a portion of
the trunk. These holes are about two feet deep and a
yard in width; the excavated earth is embanked around
the margin of the holes. This work being completed,
they next collect an immense quantity of dry branches
and trunks of trees, of which there is always a profusion
scattered around, having been broken by the elephants
in former years. These they pile above the holes to the
height of eight or nine feet, and then set fire to the heap.
When these strong fires have burnt down, and the whole
of the wood is reduced to ashes, the holes and the surrounding
earth are heated to a high degree. Ten or
twelve men then stand round the pit and take out the
ashes with a pole about sixteen feet in length, having a
hook at the end. They relieve one another in quick
succession, each man running in and raking the ashes for
a few seconds, and then pitching the pole to his comrade,
and retreating, since the heat is so intense that it
is scarcely to be endured. When all the ashes are thus
raked out beyond the surrounding bank of earth, each
elephant’s foot and portion of the trunk is lifted by two
athletic men, standing side by side, who place it on their
shoulders, and, approaching the pit together, they heave
it into it. The long pole is now again resumed, and
with it they shove in the heated bank of earth upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
foot, shoving and raking until it is completely buried in
the earth. The hot embers, of which there is always a
great supply, are then raked into a heap above the foot,
and another bonfire is kindled over each, which is
allowed to burn down and die a natural death; by
which time the enormous foot or trunk will be found to
be equally baked throughout its inmost parts. When
the foot is supposed to be ready, it is taken out of the
ground with pointed sticks, and is first well beaten, and
then scraped with an assagai, whereby adhering particles
of sand are got rid of. The outside is then pared
off, and it is transfixed with a sharp stake for facility of
carriage. The feet thus cooked are excellent, as is
also the trunk, which very much resembles buffalo’s
tongue.’</p>

<p>Elephants’ petit(?) toes, pickled in strong toddy vinegar
and cayenne pepper, are considered in Ceylon an
Apician luxury. As soon as it is known that an elephant
has been killed in Africa, every man in the neighbourhood
sets off with his knife and basket for the place, and
takes home as much of the carcase as he can manage to
carry. The flesh is not only eaten when fresh, but is
dried and kept for months, and is then highly esteemed.</p>

<p>The manner in which the elephant is cut up is thus
described by the author and sportsman I have already
quoted:—‘The rough outer skin is first removed, in
large sheets, from the side which lies uppermost.
Several coats of an under skin are then met with. The
skin is of a tough and pliant nature, and is used by the
natives for making water-bags, in which they convey
supplies of water from the nearest <i>vey</i>, or fountain
(which is often ten miles distant), to the elephant. They
remove this inner skin with caution, taking care not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
cut it with the assagai; and it is formed into water bags
by gathering the corners and edges, and transfixing the
whole on a pointed wand. The flesh is then removed in
enormous sheets from the ribs, when the hatchets come
into play, with which they chop through and remove
individually each colossal rib. The bowels are thus laid
bare; and in the removal of these the leading men take
a lively interest and active part, for it is throughout and
around the bowels that the fat of the elephant is mainly
found. There are few things which a Bechuana prizes
so highly as fat of any description; they will go an
amazing distance for a small portion of it. They use it
principally in cooking their sun-dried biltongue, and
they also eat it with their corn. The fat of the elephant
lies in extensive layers and sheets in his inside, and the
quantity which is obtained from a full-grown bull, in
high condition, is very great. Before it can be obtained, the
greater part of the bowels must be removed. To accomplish
this, several men eventually enter the immense cavity
of his inside, where they continue mining away with their
assagais, and handing the fat to their comrades outside
till all is bare. While this is transpiring with the sides
and bowels, other parties are equally active in removing
the skin and flesh from the remaining parts of the carcase.</p>

<p>‘In Northern Cachar, India, the flesh of the elephant is
generally eaten. The Kookies encamp in the neighbourhood
of the carcase until they have entirely consumed
it, or are driven away by the effluvia of decomposition.
Portions of the flesh that they cannot immediately eat are
dried and smoked to be kept for future consumption.</p>

<p>‘Fat of any kind is a complete godsend to the
Bechuana and other tribes of Southern Africa; and the
slaughter of an elephant affords them a rich harvest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
in disembowelling the carcase, and mining their way
into the interior of the huge cavity to remove the immense
layers furnished by such a large animal if in good
condition.’</p>

<p>Galton, the African traveller, in his hints for bush
cooking, tells us:—</p>

<p>‘The dish called <i>beatee</i> is handy to make. It is a kind
of haggis made with blood, a good quantity of fat shred
small, some of the tenderest of the flesh, together with
the heart and lungs of the animal, cut or torn into small
shivers, all of which is put into the stomach and roasted,
by being suspended before the fire with a string. Care
must be taken that it does not get too much heat at
first, or it will burst. It is a most delicious morsel,
even without pepper, salt, or any seasoning.’</p>

<p>In all the large rivers of Southern Africa, and especially
towards the mouths, the hippopotami abound.
The colonists give them the name of sea-cows. The
capture of one of these huge beasts, weighing, as they
sometimes do, as much as four or five large oxen, is an immense
prize to the hungry Bushman or Koranna, as the
flesh is by no means unpalatable; and the fat, with
which these animals are always covered, is considered
delicious. When salted it is called zee-koe speck, is very
much like excellent fat bacon, and is greatly prized by
the Dutch colonists, not only for the table, but for the
reputed medicinal qualities which are attributed to it.
In Abyssinia, hippopotamus meat is commonly eaten.</p>

<p>The hog is one of those animals that are doomed to
clear the earth of refuse and filth, and that convert
the most nauseous offal into the nicest nutriment in its
flesh. It has not altogether been unaptly compared to
a miser, who is useless and rapacious in his life, but at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
his death becomes of public use by the very effects of
his sordid manners. During his life he renders little
service to mankind, except in removing that filth which
other animals reject.</p>

<p>A delicate sucking pig, a Bath chap, or a good
rasher of bacon are, however, tit-bits not to be despised.</p>

<p>Lord Brougham hoped to see the day when every
man in the United Kingdom would read Bacon. ‘It
would be much better to the purpose,’ said Cobbett,
‘if his lordship would use his influence that every man
in the kingdom could eat bacon.’</p>

<p>In British India, only Europeans and the low
Hindoos eat pork, but wild hogs are very abundant,
and afford good sport to the hunter. The avoidance
of pork arises as much from religious scruples as the
deep-rooted aversion to the domestic swine all must
imbibe who have only seen it in the East, where it is a
tall, gaunt, half famished, and half ferocious-looking
brute, which performs the office of scavenger.</p>

<p>The legend which ascribes to the eating of human
flesh the origin of one of the most loathsome of diseases,
scarce offers a more horrible picture to the imagination
than is presented by a letter recently published in the
<i>Ceylon Examiner</i>. The beautiful islands of Mauritius
and Bourbon are largely supplied with pork from Patna,
a province of Hindostan that has been over-run by the
cholera. Both there and at Calcutta the bodies of the
natives are consigned to the Ganges, instead of being
interred. ‘Let any person,’ says the writer in the
Ceylon paper, ‘at daybreak start from the gates of
Government House, Calcutta, and, whether his walk
will be to the banks of the river or to the banks of
the canals which on three sides surround the city, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
will see pigs feeding on the dead bodies of the natives
that have been thrown there during the night. During
the day the river police clear away and sink all that remains
of the bodies. Bad as is the metropolis of India
it is nothing compared to Patna. Hundreds upon hundreds
of human corpses are there strewed along the
strand; and fattening, ghoule-like, upon these are
droves upon droves of swine. These swine are
slaughtered, cut up, and salted into hams, bacon,
and pickled pork, and then despatched to Calcutta....
The great market for this poisonous swine
produce is the Mauritius and Bourbon, where it is
foisted on the inhabitants as the produce of Europe.
Moreover, as these swine are sold in Calcutta at 3s.
or 4s. each carcase, it is stated that the inferior class
of homeward-bound vessels are provisioned with them,
and thus this human-fed pork is introduced into Europe
and America.’</p>

<p>Pork-eaters may believe as much of the following
remarks as they please. ‘It is said that the Jews,
Turks, Arabians, and all those who observe the precept
of avoiding blood and swine’s flesh, are infinitely more
free from disease than Christians; more especially do
they escape those opprobria of the medical art, gout,
scrofula, consumption, and madness. The Turks eat
great quantities of honey and pastry, and much sugar;
they also eat largely, and are indolent, and yet do not
suffer from dyspepsia as Christians do. The swine-fed
natives of Christendom suffer greater devastation from
a tubercular disease of the bowels (dysentery) than from
any other cause. Those persons who abstain from
swine’s flesh and blood are infinitely more healthy and
free from humors, glandular diseases, dyspepsia, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
consumption; while in those districts, and among those
classes, of men, where the pig makes the chief article of
diet, tubercle in all its forms of eruptions, sore legs, bad
eyes, abscesses, must prevail.’</p>

<p>These are the remarks of an American journalist,
which, however, have not, I conceive, the shadow of
foundation.</p>

<p>‘It appears somewhat singular,’ remarks Mr. Richardson,
in his history of the pig, ‘that the flesh of the hog
was prohibited in the ceremonial of the Jewish law;
the same prohibition being afterwards borrowed by
Mahomet, and introduced into the Koran.’ Great
difference of opinion prevails as to the cause of this
prohibition; some alleging that this food was unsuited
to the land inhabited by the Jews. As, however, the
kinds of food to be eaten and rejected—doubtless to
prevent that luxurious epicurism unsuited to a growing
and prosperous nation—were to have a limit, this limit
was fixed by two distinctive marks: they must ‘divide
the hoof, and chew the cud;’ that principle of restriction
admitting only a limited range to the food
permitted. The pig, the horse, and the camel were
excluded. It was only in a state of low nationality, or
in times of great degeneracy, that the Jew ever tasted
pork.</p>

<p>The food of the hog varies in different localities, and
probably materially influences the flavour of the meat.
In the River Plata provinces they feed them on mutton.
After describing the purchase—8,000 at <i>eighteen-pence
per dozen</i> (?)—by a Mr. M. Handy, a traveller adds,
‘As soon as the sheep became fattened on his own
lands, he killed about a thousand, sold the fleeces at
five shillings per dozen, and with the mutton he fed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
herd of swine. Mentioning this fact to a large party
of Europeans, at the dinner table of Lord Howden,
when in Buenos Ayres, my statement was received with
a murmur of scepticism; but I offered to accompany
the incredulous to the pastures, where the remainder of
the sheep were then feeding.’—(<i>Two Thousand Miles’
Ride through the Argentine Provinces.</i>) But the Yankees
beat this, according to a late American paper. In North
America they generally feed them on maize, but in
some of the States, apples form a principal portion of
their food, and the ‘apple sauce’ thus becomes incorporated
with the flesh. A gentleman travelling down East,
overtook a farmer dragging a lean, wretched-looking,
horned sheep along the road. ‘Where are you going
with that miserable animal?’ asked the traveller. ‘I
am taking him to the mutton mill, to have him ground
over,’ said the farmer. ‘The <i>mutton mill</i>? I never
heard of such a thing. I will go with you and witness
the process.’ They arrived at the mill; the sheep was
thrown alive into the hopper, and almost immediately
disappeared. They descended to a lower apartment,
and, in a few moments, there was ejected from a spout
in the ceiling four quarters of excellent mutton, two
sides of morocco leather, a wool hat of the first quality,
a sheep’s head handsomely dressed, and two elegantly-carved
powder horns.’</p>

<p>In America they speak of hogs as other countries do
of their sugar, coffee, and general exportable staple
crops; and even when packed and cured they occasionally
compute the produce by the acre. Thus, the <i>Louisville
Courier</i> stated recently, that there were five or six
<i>acres</i> of barrelled pork piled up three tiers high, in
open lots, and not less than six acres more not packed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
which would make eighteen acres of barrels if laid side
by side, exclusive of lard in barrels, and pork bulked
down in the curing houses, sheds, &amp;c. Besides the
above slaughtered hogs, there were five or six acres
more of live hogs in pens, waiting their destiny.</p>

<p>In the Western States pork is the great idea, and
the largest owner of pigs is the hero of the prairie.
What coal has been to England, wheat to the Nile or
the Danube, coffee to Ceylon, gold to California and
Victoria, and sheep to the Cape and Australia, pork
has been to the West in America.</p>

<p>The phrase, ‘Going the whole hog,’ must have
originated in Ohio, for there they use up the entire carcases
of about three-quarters of a million of pigs, and
the inhabitants are the most ‘hoggish’ community of the
entire Union. What crocodiles were in Egypt, what
cows are in Bengal, or storks in Holland, pigs are in
Cincinnati, with this trifling difference, their sacredness
of character lasts but as long as their mortal coil; and
this is abbreviated without ceremony, and from the most
worldly motives. In life, the pig is free, is honored;
he ranges the streets, he reposes in thoroughfares, he
walks beneath your horse’s legs, or your own; he is
everywhere respected; but let the thread of his existence
be severed, and—shade of Mahomet!—what a change!
They think in Cincinnati of nothing but making the
most of him.</p>

<p>Historically, socially, gastronomically, the pig demands
our careful attention. The connection with commerce,
with the cuisine, and even with the great interest of fire
insurance, have all made him an object of particular
regard. In the early days of the Celestial Empire—as
we learn from the veracious writings of the witty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
voracious essayist, Charles Lamb—a wealthy Chinaman
was so unfortunate as to have his dwelling destroyed by
fire. Prowling around the smoking ruins, and seeking
to save some of his valuables which the conflagration
might have spared, his hand came in contact with the
smoking remains of a poor pig which had perished in
the flames; instantly, smarting with the pain, he carried
his hand to his mouth, when a peculiar flavour greeted
his palate, such as the gods (Chinese ones I mean, of
course,) might in vain have sighed for. Regardless of
pain he applied himself once more, and drew forth from
the smoking cinders the remains of the pig. Carefully
brushing off the ashes, he regaled himself with the
feast before him, but closely preserved the secret he had
learned. In a few short months, however, the taste for
roast pig came back so strong, that John Chinaman’s
house was burned down again, and again was a pig
found in the ashes. This was repeated so often that the
neighbours grew suspicious, and watched until they
ascertained that the reason for the conflagration was the
feast that invariably followed. Once out, the secret
spread like wildfire; every hill-top shone with the
flames of a burning habitation—every valley was
blackened with the ashes of a homestead; but roast pig
was dearer to a Chinaman than home or honour, and
still the work of destruction went on. Alarmed at a
course which bid fair to ruin every insurance office in
the empire, the directors petitioned in a body to the
General Court of China, for the passing of an Act that
should arrest the evil and avert their threatened ruin;
and a careful examination of the revised statutes of
China would probably show stringent resolutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
against the crime of burning houses for the sake of
roasting pigs.</p>

<p>Since the invention of the modern cooking stove, however,
although incendiarism has decreased only in a
slight degree, still it has ceased to be attributed to this
cause, and a juicy crackling is no longer suggestive of
fallen rafters, or a houseless family.</p>

<p>‘There is an old adage, ‘Give a dog a bad name, and
his ruin is accomplished.’ Such may be true of the
canine race; but the noble family of animals of which
I am treating, furnishes a striking illustration that the
proverb applies not to their numbers. A goose, it is
said, saved lordly Rome by its cackling; and had not
their list of Divinities just then been full, a grateful
people would have found for him a sedgy pool and
quiet nest in Olympus. How did the ancestors of that
same people repay the pig for a service scarcely less
important?</p>

<p>‘The veriest smatterer in the classics knows, that,
when from flaming Troy ‘Æneas the great Anchises
bore,’ seeking in strange lands a new home for his conquered
people, a white sow, attended by thirty white
little pigs, pure as herself, pointed out to him the scene
of his future empire. But what did he and his people
do for the pig in return? Did they load him with
honours? Did they cherish him with corn? Did they
treat him with respect? No! with black ingratitude,
which still merits the indignation of every admirer of
the pig, they affixed to the animal the appellation of
<i>Porcus</i>; and ‘poor cuss’ the pig would have been to
the present day, had not the Latin tongue long since
ceased to be the language of the world. But, ‘poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
cuss’ he is no longer, when in Worcester county he
spurns his classic name, and, adopting the vernacular,
he ‘grows the whole hog,’ that he may ‘pork us,’ in
return for the care which we bestow upon him.</p>

<p>‘For the sake of our farmers, who are anxious to
make a profit from pig-raising, it is greatly to be
regretted that the thirty-at-a-litter breed has disappeared
from the face of the earth. Breeding swine
with such a rate of increase must be almost as profitable
as ‘shaving’ notes at two per cent. per month;
but still the impression is irresistibly forced upon us,
that, in a family so numerous, those who came last to
dinner, at least in their infant days, would not have
gained flesh very rapidly. Indeed, in such a family it
would seem almost impossible to dispense with the services
of a wet nurse, in order to bring up profitably the
rising generation.</p>

<p>‘The course of the pig, like that of the Star of
Empire, has ever tended westward. From China we
trace him to Italy, the gloomy mountains of the Hartz,
the broad plains of Westphalia, the fertile valleys of
France, and to the waving forests of ‘Merrie England;’
all have known him since the days when their bold
barons and hungry retainers sat down to feast on the
juicy chine of the wild boar, and the savoury haunch of
venison. In green Erin, piggy has been an important
member of society; true, he has shared his master’s
meal, and basked in the comfortable warmth of his
cabin; but, like a ‘gintleman’ as he is, he has ever paid
the ‘rint;’ and St. Patrick, in the plenitude of his
power and influence, never saw the day he could have
banished him from that ‘gem of the ocean.’</p>

<p>‘When the pig first crossed to this western world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
remains in doubt. Whether he came with the Pilgrims,
pressing with the foot of a pioneer the Blarney-stone of
New England, and scanning with fearless eye the cheerless
prospect before him, or whether, regardless of liberty
of conscience, and careful only of his own comfort, he
waited till the first trials and toils of a new settlement
had been met and overcome, we have no record; enough
for us that he is here; how or where he came concerns
us not. He is among us and of us. From souse to
sausage we have loved him; from ham to harslet we
have honoured him; from chine to chops we have
cherished him. The care we have shown him has been
repaid a hundred-fold. He has loaded our tables, and
lighted our fire-sides, and smiling plenty has followed
in his steps, where hungry famine would have stalked
in his absence.</p>

<p>‘But still further towards the setting sun has been the
arena of the pig’s greatest triumphs; there have been
the fields of his widest influence. Beneath the vast
forests of Ohio, raining to the ground their yearly harvests
of mast—through her broad corn-fields, stretching
as far as the eye can see, he has roamed, and fed, and
fattened. From him, and the commercial interests he
has mainly contributed to establish, has grown a mighty
State, scarcely second to any in this confederacy; from
his ashes has arisen a new order in society—the ‘Bristleocracy
of the great West.’</p>

<p>‘A broad levee bustling with business, lofty and spacious
stores and slaughter-houses, crowded pens, and a
river bearing on its bosom steamboats in fleets—all
attest the interest which the pig has exerted on the
agricultural and commercial interests of the great State
of Ohio. He has filled the coffers of her bankers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
has bought the silks which cover her belles. He has
built the beautiful palaces which adorn the ‘Queen City
of the West,’ and feeds the princely luxury of those
who inhabit them. <i>There</i> he is almost an object of
worship, and his position is considered as about equivalent
to a patent of nobility. Fancy dimly paints the
picture, when a few years hence, the wealthy pork merchant,
who justly boasts his numerous <i>quarterings</i>, shall,
in the true spirit of heraldry, paint on the pannel of his
carriage, and on the escutcheon over his door-way, a
lustrous shield, bearing in brilliant colours a single pig,
his bristles all <i>rampant</i>, his tail closely <i>curlant</i>, and his
mouth widely <i>opant</i>, till the lions, the griffins, and the
unicorns of the Old World shall fade into insignificance
before the heraldic devices of the New.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>‘Your Spanish pig, who, by the way, is a no less important
character in his country than is his cousin in
Ireland, is not raised for the vulgar purpose of being
fried to lard, or salted down to pork. He has, in fact,
no more fat than he has hair on him. He is a long-legged,
long-snouted, and long-tailed fellow, and would have
been described by Plato as an animal without hairs.
But though the pickings on his ribs be small, they are
sweet. The Spaniard rolls the morsels under his tongue
as he does his easily-besetting sins. It is nut-fed
flesh; and has the flavour of acorns. This taste is as
much prized in the roasted joint as that of the skin in
the sherry. Pig is game in Spain. The porker does
not live there in the chimney corner, and sit in the best
arm-chair, as in Paddy’s cabin; but he roams the fields,
and goes a-nutting with the boys and girls. He eats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
grass, as there are no cows to eat it; and would milk
the goats, doubtless, if they would let him. He
evidently knows more than the same animal in other
countries; and is, in consequence, more willing to
be driven. He will squeal when he feels the knife, but
for no other reason. Nor is his squeal the same as that
heard at the North. There are more vowel sounds in
it. It is also less through the nose than in New England;
and has some gutturals even farther down the
throat than those of a Dutchman. Your wild boar is a
monster compared with him. The flesh of the latter is
to that of the former as the crisp brown of roast pig is
to the tanned hide in your riding saddle. Accordingly,
to refuse pork at a Spanish table is to pronounce yourself
‘of the circumcision;’ and should you decline a cut
of a particularly nice ham, you would be set down as no
better than a heathen. However, you never would do it—particularly
after having read this essay. I assure you
that when you may have eaten up all the chickens which
were stowed away in your saddle bags, you cannot do
better than to attack your landlord’s roast pig—provided
you can get it. Only it may cost you dear in the
reckoning, as it is thought a dish to set before the king.
You may like pork, or you may not; but one thing is
certain, it is the only meat in the Peninsula which has
juices in it. Mutton may have a very little; and should
you travel far in the country, you would see the day
when you would be glad of a leg of it. But the beef is
dry as ‘whittlings.’ An entire joint of roast beef
would kill a man as effectually as a joist of timber.
Whoever should undertake to live on Spanish beef a
twelvemonth, would become at the end of that time
what he was, in fact, at the beginning—wooden-headed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Make up your mind, therefore, to eat the meat
of the uncircumcised, if you have any thought of going
to Spain. You will often have to take your choice
between that and nothing; and my word for it, ’tis
much preferable. For the land is leaner far than pork;
and happy is that traveller, who, when he is reduced to
pickings, can find a spare-rib to work upon. Forewarned—forearmed.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>’</p>

<p>Pork is the great food of the Brazilian people. It is
prepared and eaten, according to Dr. Walshe, in a
peculiar manner. When the pig is killed, the butcher
dexterously scoops out the bones and muscular flesh,
leaving behind only the covering of fat. In this state
it is salted, folded up, and sent in great quantities to
Rio, where it is called <i>toucinho</i>. All the stores and
<i>vendas</i> are full of it, and it is used commonly for
culinary purposes, and forms an ingredient in every
Brazilian article of cookery.</p>

<p>The flesh of the peccary (after cutting away the fetid
orifice on its back) and of the wild or musk hog, both
known under the Indian appellation of quanco in
Trinidad, is much preferable to that of the domestic
swine.</p>

<p>The flesh of the rhinoceros is eaten in Abyssinia,
and by some of the Dutch settlers in the Cape Colony,
and is in high esteem. The flesh of the hippopotamus
used also to be eaten on the east coast of Africa, roasted
or boiled, and fetched a high price as a delicacy. The
fat was used in making puddings, instead of butter. The
Portuguese settlers were permitted by the priests to eat
the flesh of this animal in Lent, passing it off as <i>fish</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
from its amphibious habits, and hence their consciences
were at ease.</p>

<p>The flesh of the tapir, when roasted, closely resembles
beef, especially if it be young; and that of the
water hare is also considered excellent food, being
white and delicate, and much of the same flavour as
that of the tapir.</p>

<p class="c">HORSE-FLESH.</p>

<p>At Paris, where all eccentricities are found, and even
encouraged, one of the latest gastronomic innovations is
the use of horse-flesh. The French are always adding to
their dietetic regimen by introducing new articles of
food. This social phenomenon of making the horse contribute
to the nourishment of the human race, is not
altogether new. The ancient Germans and Scandinavians
had a marked liking for horse-flesh. The nomade
tribes of Northern Asia make horse-flesh their favorite
food. It has long been authorized and publicly sold in
Copenhagen.</p>

<p>With the high ruling prices of butcher’s meat, what
think you, gentlemen and housekeepers, of horse-flesh as
a substitute for beef and mutton? Are you innocently
ignorant of the French treatise of that eminent naturalist
and professor of zoology, M. St. Hilaire, upon horse for
food? Banquets of horse-flesh are at present the rage
in Paris, Toulouse, and Berlin. The veterinary schools
there pronounce horse-bone soup preferable beyond
measure to the old-fashioned beef-bone liquid, and
much more economical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Horse-flesh steak without sauce, and cold, is cited as
a morsel superior to the finest game that flies! and
cut, too, from a horse nearly a quarter of a century
old; one of the labouring cavalry kind who pranced at
the sound of the trumpet, and snuffed the battle from
afar off, little dreaming he was doomed to steaks, soup,
and washing-day hashes. Horse-flesh pie, too, eaten
cold, is a dainty now at Berlin and Toulouse, and boiled
horse, <i>rechauffé</i>, has usurped the place of ragouts and
secondary dishes! What a theme, hippophology, to
write upon. We shall soon hear in our city dining
rooms, ‘A piece o’ horse, my kingdom for a piece of
horse!’ ‘Waiter! a cut from the fore-shoulder, well
done.’ ‘A horse sandwich and ale, and the morning
paper.’ Our witty friend <i>Punch</i> had its horse-laugh
recently upon the subject of the sensation this movement
has created in equestrian circles.</p>

<p>A Frenchman, observes a recent writer, was one day
remonstrating against the contempt expressed by
Englishmen for French beef, the inferiority of which
he would not admit. ‘I have been two times in
England,’ said he, ‘but I nevere find the beef so
supérieur to ours. I find it vary convenient that they
bring it you on leetle pieces of stick for one penny, but
I do not find the beef supérieur.’ ‘Good gracious!’
exclaimed the Englishman, ‘you have been eating cats’
meat for beef.’ What this Frenchman did in the innocence
of his heart, his countrymen now do, it seems,
with <i>malice prepense</i>.</p>

<p>And a Frenchman of considerable reputation, in a
letter on alimentary substances, and especially upon the
flesh of the horse, calls upon the whole world to put
aside, what he considers, an ancient and absurd prejudice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
and to realize at home that famous sentence in
the geography we used to read at school, which, under
the head of Norway, informed us ‘horse-flesh is publicly
sold in the markets.’</p>

<p>‘M. Isidore St. Hilaire is very serious. He does not
merely advocate the fillet of horse-flesh—the mare soup
and fricasseed colt—in sarcastic allusion to the practice of
Parisian restaurants. He comes gravely forward, with
chapters of scientific evidence and argument, to contend
that, while animal food is absolutely necessary to the
proper nourishment of the human race, millions of
Frenchmen eat no animal food, and every year millions
of pounds of excellent meat are wasted. He knows
how the cause he advocates lends itself to ridicule—he
knows how difficult it has always been to get rid of a
prejudice—he knows the fate of innovators; but, though
a Frenchman, he braves ridicule, brings a heavy battery
of facts to destroy what he deems a prejudice, and
is already experiencing some of the triumph which
follows a hard-won victory. For seven years he has
been advocating the desirableness of eating horse-flesh—for
seven or eight years he has been collecting evidence
and gaining converts—and now he feels strong enough
to appeal to the European public in a small volume.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>‘Since then, Germany has had its ‘Banquets of Horse-flesh’
for the wits to ridicule—public feastings at which
‘cats’ meat’ was served in various forms, as soup, as
bouilli, as fillet, as cutlet; and all the feasters left the
table converted hippophagists. In 1841, horse-flesh was
adopted at Ochsenhausen and Wurtemburg, where it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
now publicly sold under the surveillance of the police.
Every week five or six horses are brought to market.
At the Lake of Constance, a large quantity of this meat
is also sold. In 1842, a banquet of 150 persons inaugurated
its public use at Königsbaden, near Stuttgard.
In 1846, the police of Baden authorized its
public sale, and Schaffhausen followed in the same
year. In 1847, at Detmold and at Weimar, public
horse-flesh banquets were held with great <i>éclat</i>—in
Karlsbad (Bohemia) and its environs, the new beef
came into general use—and at Zittau, 200 horses are
eaten annually. At Ling, after one of these banquets,
the police permitted the sale of horse-flesh, which is
now general in Austria, Bohemia, Saxony, Hanover,
Switzerland, and Belgium. The innovation made rapid
converts. In 1853, Berlin had no less than five <i>abattoirs</i>,
where 150 horses were killed and sold. At
Vienna, in 1853, there was a riot to prevent one of
these banquets; but in 1854, such progress had been
made, that 32,000 pounds weight were sold in fifteen
days, and at least 10,000 of the inhabitants habitually
ate horse-flesh.’ And now Parisian banquets of horse-flesh
are common.</p>

<p>These facts are at all events curious. Think of the
prejudices to be overcome, and think how unreasoning
is the stomach!</p>

<p>Young horses are too valuable to be brought to the
shambles, unless killed by accident. But our worn-out
hacks, of which 250 or 300 die or are killed weekly in
the metropolis,—old horses used up, are capable, we
are assured, of furnishing good meat. An old horse,
which had done duty for twenty-five years, was the
substance of a learned gastronomic feast at Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>M. St. Hilaire, the champion of this new addition to
our food resources, reasons in this fashion:—‘Horse-flesh
has long been regarded as of a sweetish disagreeable
taste, very tough, and not to be eaten without difficulty.
So many different facts are opposed to this prejudice, that
it is impossible not to recognize its slight foundation.
The free or wild horse is hunted as game in all parts
of the world where it exists—Asia, Africa, and America—and
formerly, and perhaps even now, in Europe.
The domestic horse itself is made use of as alimentary
as well as auxiliary—in some cases altogether alimentary—in
Africa, America, Asia, and in some parts of Europe.</p>

<p>‘Its flesh is relished by people the most different in
their manner of life, and of races the most diverse,
negro, Mongol, Malay, American, Caucasian. It was
much esteemed up to the eighth century among the
ancestors of some of the greatest nations of Western
Europe, who had it in general use, and gave it up with
regret. Soldiers to whom it has been served out, and
people in towns who have bought it in markets, have
frequently taken it for beef. Still more often, and
indeed habitually, it has been sold in restaurants, even
in the best, as venison, and without the customers ever
suspecting the fraud or complaining of it.</p>

<p>‘And further, if horse-flesh has been often accepted
as good under a false name, it has also been pronounced
good by those who, to judge of its qualities, have submitted
it to careful experiment, and by all who have
tasted it in a proper condition, that is, when taken from
a sound and rested horse, and kept sufficiently long.
It is then excellent roasted; and if it be not so acceptable
as <i>bouilli</i>, it is precisely because it furnishes one of
the best soups—perhaps the best that is known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>‘It is good also, as experiments prove made by myself
as well as others, when taken from old horses not
fattened, whose age was 16, 19, 20, and even 23 years,
animals thought worth no more than a few francs beyond
the value of their skin.</p>

<p>‘This is a capital fact, since it shows the possibility of
utilizing a second time, for their flesh, horses which
have already been utilized up to old age for their
strength; and, consequently, of obtaining a further and
almost gratuitous profit at the end of their life, after
they had well nigh paid the cost of their rearing and
keep by their labour.’</p>

<p>Let us see what additional evidence M. St. Hilaire
has to adduce. First, he appeals to his long experience
at the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i>, where the greater part of
the <i>carnivora</i> are habitually fed on horse-flesh, which
keeps them healthy in spite of many unfavourable conditions.
But this will not carry much weight with it.
Our digestion is not quite so good as that of a lion.
The condor has been known to eat, with satisfaction,
food which Mrs. Brown would find little to her taste.
No dietetic rule for men can be deduced from the digestions
of tigers. We prefer the experience of human
stomachs. Fortunately this is not wanting, and M. St.
Hilaire collects an imposing mass of evidence. Huzard,
the celebrated veterinary surgeon, records, that during
the revolution, the population of Paris was for six months
dieted with horse-flesh, without any ill effects. Some
complaints, indeed, were made when it was found that
the <i>beef</i> came from horses; but, in spite of prejudice
and the terrors such a discovery may have raised, no
single case of illness was attributed to the food. Larrey,
the great army surgeon, declares that on very many occasions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
during the campaigns, he administered horse-flesh
to the soldiers, and to the soldiers sick in the hospital; and
instead of finding it injurious, it powerfully contributed
to the convalescence of the sick, and drove away a scorbutic
epidemic which attacked the men. The testimony
of Parent Duchâtelet is also quoted to the same effect.
M. St. Hilaire feels himself abundantly authorized to
declare that horse-flesh, far from being unwholesome, is
one of the most nutritious and wholesome of alimentary
substances: and, to support this declaration, he adduces
the testimony of historians and travellers, showing how
whole tribes and nations have habitually eaten and
highly esteemed it.</p>

<p>Having thus, as he considers, satisfactorily settled
the question of wholesomeness, M. St. Hilaire proceeds
to deal with the question of agreeableness. Is wholesome
horse-flesh agreeable enough to tempt men, not
starving, to eat it? It is, of course, of little use that
historians and travellers tell of hippophagists—it is
nothing to the purpose that soldiers in a campaign, or
citizens during a siege, have eaten horses with considerable
relish. Under such circumstances, one’s old
shoe is not to be despised as a <i>pièce de résistance</i>; and
one’s grandmother may be a toothsome morsel. The
real point to be settled in the European mind is this—apart
from all conditions which must bias the judgment,
is horse-flesh pleasant to the taste? M. St. Hilaire
cites the evidence of eminent men who, having eaten it
knowing what it was, pronounced it excellent—all declaring
that it was better than cow-beef, and some that
there was little difference between it and ox-beef.</p>

<p>But perhaps the reader, having eaten German beef,
has a not ill-grounded suspicion that horse-flesh might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
bear honourable comparison with such meat, and yet
be at best of mediocre savour. Let us, therefore, says
a writer in the <i>Saturday Review</i>, cite the example of
Parisian banquets, where the convives were men accustomed
to the <i>Trois Frères</i>, <i>Philippe’s</i>, and the <i>Café
de Paris</i>. M. Renault, the director of the great
Veterinary College at Alfort, had a horse brought to
him with an incurable paralysis of the hinder extremities.
It was killed, and three days afterwards,
on the 1st December, 1855, eleven guests were invited—physicians,
journalists, veterinary surgeons, and
<i>employés</i> of the government. Side by side were dishes
prepared by the same cook, in precisely the same
manner, and with the same pieces taken respectively
from this horse and from an ox of good quality. The
<i>bouillon</i> of beef was flanked by a <i>bouillon</i> of horse, the
<i>bouilli</i> of beef by a <i>bouilli</i> of horse, the fillet of roast
beef by a fillet of roast horse; and a comparison was
to be made of their qualities. Dr. Amédée Latour
thus writes:—</p>

<p>‘<i>Bouillon de cheval.</i>—Surprise générale! C’est parfait,
c’est excellent, c’est nourri, c’est corse, c’est aromatique,
c’est riche de goût.</p>

<p>‘Le bouillon de <i>bœuf</i> est bon, mais <i>comparativement
inférieur</i>, moins accentué de goût, moins parfumé, moins
résistant de sapidité.’</p>

<p>The jury unanimously pronounced the horse <i>bouillon</i>
superior to that of the ox. The <i>bouilli</i>, on the contrary,
they thought inferior to that of good beef, although
superior to ordinary beef, and certainly superior
to all cow-beef. The roast fillet, again, they found
superior to that of the ox; and M. Latour thus sums
up the experiment:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>
Un bouillon supérieur;<br>
Un bouilli bon et très-mangeable;<br>
Un rôti exquis.
</p></div>

<p>Similar experiments have been subsequently tried,
several times in Paris and in the provinces. They
have been tried under three different conditions. First,
the guests have known what they were going to eat;
secondly, they have been totally ignorant; and thirdly,
they have been warned that they were going to eat
something quite novel. Yet in every case, we are told,
the result has been the same. It is right to add, that
the author anticipates the objection that the animals
selected were young horses in splendid condition, and
that such horses are too valuable to be sent to the
butcher. The majority of these experiments have, we
are assured, been made at veterinary colleges, upon
horses incapacitated by age or accident from further
work. The horse which M. Renault served up to his
friends had already <i>vingt-trois ans de bons et loyaux
services</i>. He was in good ‘condition’—that is to
say, well-fleshed, although paralysed. In fact, all the
horses, it is asserted, were such as are sold for fifteen
or twenty francs—not such as are the pride of our
stables. The younger the horse, the better his flesh;
and as young horses die daily from accidents, these,
we presume, would form the ‘prime cuts.’ But old
horses, used up, unfit even for cabs, if allowed a little
rest, are capable, we are assured, of furnishing beef
better than cow-beef. But this serving up of horse-flesh
is equalled by that of the maître de cuisine to the
Maréchal Strezzi, who, at the siege of Leith, according
to Monsieur Beaujeu, ‘made out of the hind quarter of
one salted horse forty-five <i>couverts</i>, that the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and Scottish officers and nobility who had the honour to
dine with the Monseigneur, upon the rendition, could
not tell what the devil any one of them were made
upon at all.’ M. St. Hilaire discusses at great length
many other objections, with which we need not here
trouble ourselves. But the taste is spreading and the
advocates increasing. The public use of horse-flesh as
human food is spoken of approvingly in <i>Blackwood</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Tribune</i> thus endorses the fanatical
idea of the French <i>savans</i>, (more properly <i>ravens</i>,) as
to the propriety of eating horse-flesh:—</p>

<p>‘In the horse we have an animal which is much
cleaner in its habits than the hog, herbivorous like
the ox or sheep, whose flesh is rich in nitrogen, and as
pleasant to the taste as that of either of the above-named
animals. What prevents horse-flesh from being
found on our tables? Nothing but a popular prejudice,
which recent investigations in Paris show is entirely
without any foundation whatever.</p>

<p>‘8,000 horses die, it is said, in New York annually,
or about 22 per day’ (a great exaggeration no doubt);
‘but instead of fetching 17 or 18 dollars to press the
carcase for grease, and to feed the hogs on to make
pork for export, the prices will be greatly enhanced
for meat for home consumption.’</p>

<p>Thus writes the Paris correspondent of the <i>Indépendance
Belge</i>:—‘You know what interest is attached to-day—and
very naturally so—to all questions relating to
the public food. In connexion therewith, I have to
mention a fact which is both curious and odd; it is,
that there is being formed in Paris a society of economists,
naturalists, and hardy gourmands, having for
aim the introduction of horse-flesh into the category of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
butchers’ meat. It may perhaps be said, that this social
phenomenon is not altogether new. Ten years ago,
<i>hippophagy</i> made some noise in Germany, and, if I
remember right, a society of eaters of the horse was
formed, and attempted a public festival, at which all the
meat should be of that quadruped, but were interrupted
by the public, who, feeling their prejudices wounded,
broke the tables to pieces. At Paris, where all eccentricities
are found, and even encouraged, there is nothing
of that kind to fear. Accordingly, <i>hippophagy</i> progresses.
Do not consider this an exaggeration. The
last number of the <i>Revue des Cours Publics</i> will prove
to you, by means of a summary, that M. Geoffroy de
St. Hilaire has made the subject the theme of one of
his recent lectures, and that the learned professor was
greatly applauded. I should add that his auditors
included economists, agriculturists, and heads of benevolent
institutions. When the orator concluded by
saying that the day was come when the horse ought to
contribute to the nourishment of the human race, as
well as the ox, the sheep, and the pig, a hundred
voices cried in chorus, ‘<i>Oui! oui! très bien!</i>’ This
question, strange at first sight, has been raised, and it
will not sleep again. I predict that it will have not
only numerous adherents, but eloquent fanatics. As a
commencement, many of the auditors wished to eat
horse soup, horse steaks, and the same flesh under other
forms.’ At the time at which I write, dissertations
are made, <i>brochures</i> written, the regulations of a <i>hippophagic</i>
society drawn up, and the establishment of horse
shambles demanded. In 1832, M. Alphonse Karr,
mocking the extreme zeal of the society for protection,
exclaimed—‘Philanthropists! the horse has carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
man long enough; it is now for man to carry the
horse!’</p>

<p>There is very little doubt that horse-flesh, besides
its application for ‘cats’ meat,’ enters, even now, largely
into surreptitious use in certain quarters in this country
as food for bipeds. Thus, a Blackburn paper tells us
that ‘on Monday last Mr. Laverty seized and confiscated
the carcase of a horse. The animal had been
stuck and bled, and was taken very near to the premises
of a noted brawn and black-pudding maker. We understand
that horse-flesh is used in this town by a
certain vender and manufacturer of brawn.’</p>

<p>Hoffman and Burns, makers and venders of horse-meat
sausages, at Philadelphia, were recently tried,
convicted, and sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment.
<i>Apropos</i> of sausages, judging from the following
anecdote, home-made ones are the more attractive.</p>

<p>‘A minister in one of our orthodox churches, while
on his way to preach a funeral sermon in the country,
called to see one of his members, an old widow lady,
who lived near the road he was travelling. The old
lady had just been making sausages, and she felt proud
of them—they were so plump, round, and sweet. Of
course she insisted on her minister taking some of the
links home to his family. He objected on account of
not having his portmanteau along with him. This objection
was soon over-ruled, and the old lady, after
wrapping them in a rag, carefully placed a bundle in
either pocket of the preacher’s capacious great coat.
Thus equipped, he started for the funeral.</p>

<p>‘While attending to the solemn ceremonies of the
grave, some hungry dogs scented the sausages, and
were not long in tracking them to the pockets of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
good man’s over-coat. Of course this was a great
annoyance, and he was several times under the necessity
of kicking these whelps away. The obsequies at
the grave completed, the minister and congregation
re-passed to the church, where the funeral discourse
was to be preached.</p>

<p>‘After the sermon was finished, the minister halted
to make some remarks to his congregation, when a
brother who wished to have an appointment given out,
ascended the steps of the pulpit, and gave the minister’s
coat a hitch to get his attention. The divine,
thinking it a dog having designs upon his pocket,
raised his foot, gave a sudden kick, and sent the good
brother sprawling down the steps!</p>

<p>‘You will excuse me, brethren and sisters,’ said the
minister, confusedly, and without looking at the work
he had just done, ‘for I could not avoid it—I have
sausages in my pocket, and that dog has been trying to
grab them ever since I came upon the premises!’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The reader may judge of the effect such an announcement
would have at a funeral. Tears of sorrow
were suddenly exchanged for smiles of merriment.</p>

<p>Mr. Richardson, officer of the Local Board of Health
of Newton Heath, near Manchester, gave the following
evidence before Mr. Scholefield’s Committee
on Adulteration, before whom I was also examined as
a witness.</p>

<p>‘We have in Newton five knackers’ yards, and there
is only one in Manchester. The reason is, that they
have so much toleration in Newton; and it has been a
great source of profit to them, because they have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
means of selling the best portions of the horse-flesh to
mix with the potted meats.</p>

<p>‘I can say for a fact, that the tongues of horses
particularly, and the best portions, such as the hind
quarters of horses, are generally sold to mix with
collared brawn, or pigs’ heads, as they are called with
us, and for sausages and polonies. I understand, also,
from those who have been in the habit of making them,
that horse-flesh materially assists the making of sausages;
It is a hard fibrin, and it mixes better, and keeps them
hard, and they last longer in the shop window before
they are sold, because otherwise the sausages run to
water, and become soft and pulpy. I believe horse-flesh
also materially assists German sausages; it keeps
them hard.’</p>

<p>The instinct of the dog, the cat, and the rat, are so
well known that one anecdote will suffice to illustrate
the three. A terrier and a tom cat were pursuing a
large rat down a street. The rat was almost caught,
when it dodged suddenly and ran into a sausage shop.
The cat and dog stopped convulsively at the door; and,
looking at the sausages, hung their heads, and slunk
away terror-stricken.</p>

<p>But in other quarters than England, unwholesome
and infected meat is vended, for a year or two ago the
editor of the <i>Madras Athenæum</i> thus wrote:—</p>

<p>‘We question whether since the days of Pelops a
more filthy dish was ever offered to human beings, than
those which are daily served up to the European inhabitants
of Madras. With respect to the state of our
market, we have never seen a more disgusting receptacle
of all kinds of abominations than that market
presents.</p>

<div class="verse indent0">‘A lazar house it seemed, wherein were laid</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Numbers of all diseased.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Unfortunate beings in the worst stages of leprosy,
naked, and covered all over with the livid spots of that
hideous disease, standing at the stalls, handling the
meat, and talking with the butchers, is a sight as common
as it is horrible. As for the small-pox, that is
almost too abundant to allow of any cases being particularly
noticed. It is very conspicuous on the native,
on account of the pustules being white. The only disease
bearing any resemblance to it is the itch. We
have ourselves observed a dirty fellow, with his hands
covered all over with one of these nauseous eruptions,
coolly walking down the whole length of a set of stalls,
and clapping those abominable hands, in a lazy manner,
upon every piece of meat within his reach. Faugh!
The very thought smells. When we were last there,
the place swarmed with pariah dogs, the effect of which
was to render the stench and filth accumulated round
the stalls perfectly unbearable. We are aware the subject
is a nasty one, but at the risk of spoiling the breakfast
of Brown, Jones, or Robinson, as they take up our
damp sheet this morning, we make the evil conspicuous,
and bring it plainly into notice, that measures may be
taken to sink it into oblivion ever after. If one could
jest upon such a subject, one might say, that the market
of Madras is as much the morning lounge of the
filthiest wretches in the place, as the stables of Taylor
and Co. are the morning rendezvous of the rank and
fashion, who there do congregate, to look at the Australians
and Arabs ushered to their notice under the
winning smile of the worthy head partner. Is not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
thought horrible, too, that the fairer part of the creation,
who should be fed on</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>are offered such filthy and infected stuff?</p>

<p>‘We should also recommend attention being called to
the practice, which we are afraid prevails, of ‘blowing
the meat,’ to give it a good appearance. This is a
cognizable offence, and butchers have, on occasion, most
deservedly received a dozen or two for it; but the inducement
to make their meat look tempting by filling
it with breath, not quite so ‘fragrant as the flower of
Amrou,’ is too profitable, we fear, to be disregarded
upon the vague and distant contingency of a flogging
or a fine. If the functionaries who are employed to
superintend the market are insufficient in number, it
would surely be poor economy not to increase them.
If they are inattentive and remiss, discharge them. It
would be pennywise, indeed, for a few paltry rupees a
month, to allow a Secretary to Government, or a Member
of Council, whose wisdom and experience have been
purchased at an immense cost to the country, to be
poisoned, which at present they are liable to be, by infected
meat.</p>

<p>‘If by calling attention to the subject, some improvement
is made, our object will be attained. We will
gladly run the chance of spoiling a few dinners. Jones
of the club, as he takes the cover off one of Maltby’s
best <i>entrées</i>, may for once think of the leprous hand
that has handled it; Brown may fancy for once he will
catch small-pox from his beef-steak; Robinson may think
of the dog licking the leg of mutton from which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
whack is taken, and all may heartily anathematise the
<i>Athenæum</i> for telling them the truth, but we will cheerfully
put up with their wry faces and abuse, if the
necessary reform we advocate be attained.’</p>

<p>Sam Slick, in his truthful, but satirical vein, alludes
to the disguises of fashionable cookery.—‘Veal’ (he says)
‘to be good, must look like anything else but veal. You
mustn’t know it when you see it, or it’s vulgar; mutton
must be incog, too; beef must have a mask on; any
thin’ that looks solid, take a spoon to; any thin’ that
looks light, cut with a knife; if a thing looks like fish,
you take your oath it is flesh; and if it seems real flesh,
it’s only disguised, for it’s sure to be fish; nothin’
must be nateral—natur is out of fashion here. This is
a manufacturin’ country; everything is done by machinery,
and <i>that</i> that aint, must be made to look like
it; and I must say, the dinner machinery is perfect.’</p>

<p>If horses are eaten, why not donkeys? The animal is
more rare, and hence it would be the greater delicacy.
The Greeks ate donkeys, and we must suppose they
had their reasons for it. Has any modern stomach in
Europe been courageous enough, knowingly, to try it?</p>

<p>The flesh of the common ass, though never eaten by
us, is esteemed a delicacy in some countries, particularly
in Tartary. The northern climate, pasturage, and
freedom may have some effect on the flesh.</p>

<p>Travellers affirm that dogs’ flesh, which with us is
intolerable, is one of the most savoury meats, when
the animal has been kept for some time in the warm,
tropical regions. This cannot, however, apply to the
brutish pariah dogs that infest the streets of Madras,
Constantinople, and other eastern towns.</p>

<p>The Roman peasants found the flesh of the ass palatable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and the celebrated Mæcenas having tasted it, introduced
it to the tables of the great and rich, but the
fashion of eating it lasted no longer than his life. Galen
compares the flesh of the ass to that of the stag. It is
said to be eaten plentifully in the low eating-houses of
Paris, under the denomination of veal. The flesh of
the wild ass is eaten by the Tartars, and is said to be
very delicate and good, but when killed in a tame state,
it is hard and unfit for food.</p>

<p>The wild ass, called Koulan by the Persians, is still
common in many parts of Central Asia, from the 48° of
North latitude to the confines of India. The Persians
and Tartars hold its flesh in high esteem, and hunt it
in preference to all other descriptions of game. Olearius
assures us, that he saw no fewer than 32 wild
asses slain in one day, by the Shah of Persia and his
court, the bodies of which were sent to the royal
kitchens at Ispahan; and we know from Martial, that
the epicures of Rome held the flesh of the Onager,
or wild ass, in the same estimation as we do venison.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">Cum tener est <i>Onager</i>, solaque lalisio matre</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Pascitur; hoc infans, sed breve nomen habet.</div>
<div class="verse indent3">[Martial, xiii. 97.]</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From a passage in Pliny (lib. viii., c. 44), it would
appear, that the Onager inhabited Africa; and that the
most delicate and best flavoured <i>lalisiones</i>, or fat foals,
were brought from that continent to the Roman markets.
Leo Africanus repeats the same story of wild asses being
found in Africa, but no traveller has since met with
them; and, as far as we at present know, the species is
confined to Asia.</p>

<p>The quaggas (<i>Asinus Quagga</i>) are often hunted in
Africa by the Dutch for their skins, of which they make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
large bags to hold their grain, and by the Hottentots
and other natives, who are very fond of their flesh.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Moodie (<i>Ten Years in South Africa</i>) says,
‘Being one morning at the house of a neighbouring
farmer who had just shot one of these animals, I requested
that he would have a piece of the flesh cooked
for my breakfast. His ‘frow’ expressed some disgust
at my proposal, but ordered a small bit to be grilled,
with butter and pepper. I did not find it at all unpalatable,
and certainly it was better than horse-flesh, to
which I had been treated in the hospital at Bergen-op-Zoom
in 1814, when lying wounded there, after the
unfortunate failure of that well-planned attack.’</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c" id="ca">RUMINANTIA.</p>

<p>The ruminants furnish, as is well known, the largest
portion of our animal food, being consumed by man alike
in civilized or unsettled countries. The domestic animals
require little notice at our hands. There are,
however, some whose flesh is eaten in different countries
that are less familiar. Thus the bison and musk-ox
of North America, the reindeer of Greenland and
Northern Europe—the various antelopes, the gnu, the
giraffe, and the camel of Africa, and the alpaca tribe
of South America, supply much of the animal food of
the people in the districts where they are common.</p>

<p>The flesh of the camel is dry and hard, but not unpalatable.
Heliogabalus had camels’ flesh and camels’
feet served up at his banquets. In Barbary, the tongues
are salted and smoked for exportation to Italy and other
countries, and they form a very good dish. The flesh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
is little esteemed by the Tartars, but they use the hump
cut into slices, which, dissolved in tea, serves the purpose
of butter.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Axis deer (<i>Cervus axis</i>, or <i>Axis
maculata</i>) is not much esteemed in Ceylon, having little
fat upon it, and being very dry. The India samver,
or musk deer, is eaten there.</p>

<p>The flesh of the great moose deer or elk, of North
America, the carcase of which weighs 1,000 or 1,200 lbs.,
is as valuable for food as beef, but from its immense
size, much of the flesh is usually left in the forest.</p>

<p>It is more relished by the Indians and persons
resident in the fur countries, than that of any other
animal, and bears a greater resemblance in its flavour
to beef than to venison. It is said that the external fat
is soft like that of a breast of mutton, and when put
into a bladder is as fine as marrow.</p>

<p>The flesh of the caribboo, a smaller animal, rarely
exceeding 400 lbs., is less palatable than moose venison.
Nor is the flesh of the red or Virginian deer much
better, although the venison dried is very good.</p>

<p>Venison is not ‘meat’ in the parlance of the backwoodsman;
that term, as Sam Slick tells us, is reserved
<i>par excellence</i> for pork; and he is frequently too indolent
or too much occupied otherwise, to hunt, although
deer tracks may be seen in every direction around the
scene of his daily rail-splitting operations. He considers
it cheaper to buy venison of the Indians, when there
are any Indians in the locality. But venison has some
solid value even in those parts, and if salted and smoked,
would be entitled to a place among the articles of
household thrift.</p>

<p>Of the Arctic quadrupeds, the reindeer (<i>Cervus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
tarandus</i>) is most valuable, its flesh being juicy, nutritious,
and well-flavoured, and easy of digestion. They
abound in Greenland, and are tolerably numerous in
Melville Island.</p>

<p>In Sweden, roast reindeer steaks and game are
dressed in a manner preferable to that which prevails
with us. The flesh is first perforated, and little bits of
lard inserted; and, after being baked in an oven, it is
served in a quantity of white sauce.</p>

<p>The flesh of the young giraffe is said to be good
eating. The Hottentots hunt the animal principally on
account of its marrow, which, as a delicacy, they set a
high value on.</p>

<p>The Hottentots have a curious mode of cooking their
antelope venison, which renders it, however, exceedingly
palatable. After stewing the meat in a very
small quantity of water, they take it out of the pot and
pound it between two stones until reduced to the consistency
of pap, when they mix it with a considerable
quantity of sheep’s fat, and then stew it for a short
time longer. This is an excellent way of preparing
dry flesh of any kind.</p>

<p>‘On one occasion’ (says Lieut. Moodie), ‘after I had
taken out my share of this mess, the Hottentots added
a larger quantity of fat to it to please their own palates;
and one of them ate so heartily of the greasy mixture,
that he became seriously unwell, but recovered by
chewing dry roots of the sweet-scented flag (<i>Calamus
aromaticus</i>). This plant is very much used by the
Dutch for stomach complaints, and they generally
cultivate some of it in wet places in their gardens.’</p>

<p>The eland of Africa (<i>Boselaphus Oreas</i>) is the largest
of the antelope tribe, its size being indicated by its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
generic name. The bulls attain to the height of nineteen
hands at the shoulder, and frequently exceed
1,000 lbs. in weight. It fattens readily on the most
meagre herbage of the desert, and to the delicious,
tender, juicy, and wholesome nature of its flesh every
hunter will bear witness, who has regaled himself on the
steaks broiled in the homely style of South African
cookery, with some of the usual condiments or spices to
give them an unnatural relish. The flesh has a peculiar
sweetness, and is tender and fit for use the moment
the animal is killed.</p>

<p>It is hunted with avidity, on account of the delicacy
of its flesh, but is very rarely found within the limits of
the Cape Colony, having been driven beyond the
Orange River by the progress of colonization.</p>

<p>The hartebeest, an antelope of the size of the Scotch
red deer, though now rather rare, is much prized by the
African sportsman. It is also called caama by the
Dutch farmers, and is a favourite object of pursuit with
both natives and colonists. The flesh is rather dry, but
of a fine grain, more nearly resembling the beef of the
ox than that of any other antelope, except, perhaps, the
so-called eland or elk of the colonists (<i>A. oreas</i>, Pallas),
and it has a high game flavour which makes it universally
esteemed.</p>

<p>The meat of the sassaby (<i>A. lunata</i>, Burchell), a rare
species, is tender and well tasted. The flesh of the ourebi
of Southern Africa (<i>A. scoparia</i>, Schreber), though dry
and destitute of fat, is esteemed one of the best venisons
of the country.</p>

<p>The flesh of the bosh-bok, or bush goat, as its colonial
name implies (<i>A. sylvatica</i>, Sparrman), makes good
venison, that of the breast being particularly esteemed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
The flesh of the rheebok (<i>A. capreolus</i>, Lichstenstein)
is dry and insipid, and relished less than that of any other
of the numerous Cape antelopes. The bush antelope (<i>A.
silvicultrix</i>, Afzelius) affords excellent venison, and
is much sought after on that account. The flesh of the
ahu (<i>A. subgutturosa</i>, Guldenstaedt) is excellent, and
of an agreeable taste. That of the gnu of South
Africa is in great repute both among the natives and
Dutch settlers. Though the meat has a wildish flavour,
it is more juicy than that of most of the antelope
tribe, and very much like beef.</p>

<p>The flesh of the alpaca and guanaco is sold in the
public shambles of Peru, Chili, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sheep’s milk is a common beverage in Toorkistan,
where the sheep are milked regularly three times a day.
Goats are very scarce; cows not to be seen; but the
sheep’s milk affords nourishment in various forms, of
which the most common is a kind of sour cheese, being
little better than curdled milk and salt.</p>

<p>If we think ox tails a delicacy, Australians (as we
have seen) like kangaroo tails, and the Cape colonists
have fat sheep’s tails requiring a barrow or a cart on
which to support them. The broad fat tail, which often
composes one-third of the weight of the animal, is entirely
composed of a substance betwixt marrow and fat,
which serves very often for culinary purposes instead
of butter; and being cut into small pieces, makes an
ingredient in various dishes.</p>

<p>The dried flesh of the argali, or wild sheep, is in
Kamtschatka an article of commerce.</p>

<p>The domestic goat’s flesh is not in much favour anywhere,
although that of a young kid, three or four months
old, is very tender and delicate. Some of the goats are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
eaten in the Cape Colony, but the flesh is generally lean
and tough. The Malabar goat is a delicate animal, that
browzes on the rocks. It is more sought after than any
game in Ceylon, for, contrary to the general nature of
the goat, its flesh is tender and excellent when broiled.</p>

<p>Bison beef, especially that of the female, is rather
coarser grained than that of the domestic ox, but is considered
by hunters and travellers as superior in tenderness
and flavour. The hump, which is highly celebrated
for its richness and delicacy, is said, when properly
cooked, to resemble marrow. The flesh of the buffalo,
as it is misnamed, is the principal, sometimes the only,
food of numerous tribes of North American Indians.
It is eaten fresh on the prairies during the hunt, and
dried in their winter villages.</p>

<p>The musk-ox (<i>Ovibos moschatus</i>) is of much importance
from its size and palatable rich meat. It
has occasionally furnished a rich meal to arctic explorers.
When they are fat, the flesh is well flavoured,
but smells strongly of musk.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c" id="cb">CETACEA.</p>

<p>The flesh of the manatus is white and delicate, and
tastes like young pork eaten fresh or salted, while the
fat forms excellent lard. The cured flesh keeps long
without corruption, and it will continue good several
weeks, even in the hot climate of which it is a native,
when other meat would not resist putrefaction for as
many days. The fibres and the lean part of the flesh
are like beef, but more red; it takes a very long time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
boiling. The fat of the young one is like pork, and can
scarcely be distinguished from it, while the lean eats
like veal. The fat, which lies between the entrails and
skin has a pleasant smell, and tastes like the oil of sweet
almonds. It makes an admirable substitute for butter,
and does not turn rancid in the sun. The fat of the
tail is of a firmer consistence, and when boiled is more
delicate than the other.</p>

<p>Manatees, or sea calves, are found in certain parts of
British Honduras in great numbers. They are, according
to my friend, Chief Justice Temple, frequently caught
and brought to the market of Belize, where they are
snapped up with the greatest avidity. He states the
flesh to be white and delicate, something between pork
and veal. The tail, which is very fat, is most esteemed.
This caudal luxury is generally soused or pickled. I
do not, myself, fancy the flesh of this brute, for it is so
inhumanly human—it reminds one so much of a mermaid,
or of one of the fifty daughters of Nereus, that to eat it
seems to me to be an approximation to cannibalism. It
appears horrible to chew and swallow the flesh of an
animal which holds its young (it has never more than
one at a litter) to its breast, which is formed exactly
like that of a woman, with paws resembling human
hands. But these notions would be considered highly
fantastic by those who masticate a monkey with the
greatest relish, partake with gusto of rattlesnake soup,
and voraciously devour an alligator stew. The manatus
is commonly found in shallow water, at the mouths
of rivers, where it feeds upon the marine herbage which
there grows in great luxuriance. It has no teeth, but
two thick, smooth, hard, unserrated bones run from one
side of the mouth to the other. I am inclined to think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
that these bones might be used as a substitute for
ivory.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Mr. P. H. Gosse, in his interesting little manual on
the <i>Natural History of the Mammalia</i>, remarks:—</p>

<p>‘From personal experience we can confirm Hernandez’s
statement of the excellence of the flesh of the
manatee; he truly compares it to well fatted pork, of
pleasant flavour. The pursuit of it, on this account,
has rendered it scarce in many localities, where it was
formerly numerous; in the vicinity of Cayenne, it was
at one time so common, that a large boat might be filled
with them in a day, and the flesh was sold at 3<i>d.</i> per
pound. About the middle of the last century it fetched,
at Port Royal in Jamaica, 15<i>d.</i> currency per pound.’</p>

<p>The tongue of the sea-lion (<i>Phoca jubata</i>) is very
good eating, and some seamen prefer it to that of an ox
or calf. Thus Dr. Pernetty (<i>Voyage to the Falkland
Islands</i>) says,—‘For a trial we cut off the tip of the
tongue hanging out of the mouth of one of these lions
which was just killed. About sixteen or eighteen of us
ate each a pretty large piece, and we all thought it so
good that we regretted we could not eat more of it.</p>

<p>‘It is said that their flesh is not absolutely disagreeable.
I have not tasted it, but the oil which is extracted
from their grease is of great use. This oil is
extracted in two ways; either by cutting the fat in
pieces and melting it in large caldrons upon the fire,
or by cutting it in the same manner upon hurdles or
pieces of board, and exposing them to the sun, or only
to the air. This grease dissolves of itself and runs into
vessels placed underneath to receive it. Some of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
seamen pretended that this last sort of oil, when it is
fresh, is very good for kitchen uses. It is preferred to
that of the whale; is always clear, and leaves no sediment.’</p>

<p>Walrus meat is strong, coarse, and of a game-like
flavour. Seal flesh is exceedingly oily, and not very
palatable; but by practice, residents in the northern
regions learn to relish both exceedingly.</p>

<p>The large tongue, the heart, and liver of the walrus
(<i>Trichecus rosmarus</i>), are often eaten by whalers for want
of better fresh provisions, and are passably good.</p>

<p>Commodore Anson’s party killed many sea-lions for
food, using, particularly, the hearts and tongues, which
they thought excellent eating, and preferable even to
those of bullocks. The flesh of the female sea-bear
(<i>Phoca ursina</i>, Lin.) they found very delicate, having
the taste of lamb; while that of the cub could scarcely
be distinguished from roasted pig.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Parry was once asked, at a dinner where
Lord Erskine was present, what he and his crew had
lived upon when they were frozen in in the Polar Seas.
Parry said they lived upon seals. ‘A very good living,
too,’ exclaimed the Chancellor, ‘if you keep them long
enough.’</p>

<p>One of the ordinary acts of hospitality and civility
on the part of the Esquimaux ladies, is to take a bird,
or piece of seal-flesh, chew it up very nicely, and hand
it to the visitor, who is expected to be overcome with
gratitude, and finish the operation of chewing and digesting
the delicate morsel.</p>

<p>The carcase and blubber of the whale at Bahia, in
Brazil, are reduced to food by the poor.</p>

<p>To most of the rude littoral tribes of Northern Asia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
and America, the whale and seal furnish, not only food
and clothing, but many other useful materials. The
Esquimaux will eat the raw flesh of the whale with the
same apparent relish, when newly killed, or after it has
been buried in the ground for several months.</p>

<p>The whales on the coasts of Japan not only afford
oil in great abundance, but their flesh, which is there
considered very wholesome and nutritious, is largely
consumed. No part of them, indeed, is thrown away;
all is made available to some useful purpose or another.
The skin, which is generally black, the flesh, which is red
and looks like coarse beef, the intestines and all the inward
parts, besides the fat or blubber, which is boiled
into oil, and the bone, which is converted into innumerable
uses,—all is made available to purposes of profit.</p>

<p>Both sperm and black whales abound on the coast of
Western Australia. Sometimes a dead whale is thrown
on the shore, and affords luxurious living to the natives.
They do not, however, eat the shark.</p>

<p>The natives of New Zealand, when short of food,
will not scruple to eat the flesh of the whale, when
caught in their vicinity.</p>

<p>The deep has many food dainties as well as the land,
as we shall shortly have to notice, and among these
is the porpoise, which the reader may probably have
seen dashing up our rivers, or, during a long voyage,
disporting itself amid the briny waves, and rolling
gracefully near the sides of the ship. This sea pig
sometimes serves for a feast. When caught, it is cut
into steaks, dried, and put into the ship’s coppers, with
a <i>quantum suf.</i> of spices and condiments which nearly
overpower the oily taste. The steaks turn blackish on
being exposed to the air, but this is ‘a matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
nothing’ to those whose daily diet is usually limited to
hard biscuits and salt junk. Landsmen may question
the niceness of the palate which partakes of this dainty,
but the old adage holds true everywhere, ‘de gustibus
non disputandum.’ There is no disputing about tastes.</p>

<p>According to ancient records, salted porpoises were
formerly used for food in this country.</p>

<p>In the olden times, when glass windows were considered
an effeminate luxury, and rushes supplied the
place of carpets, the flesh of the porpoise constituted
one of the standard delicacies of a public feast. It was
occasionally served up at the tables of the old English
nobility as a sumptuous article of food, and eaten
with a sauce composed of sugar, vinegar, and crumbs of
fine bread. But tastes have altered, and even sailors
will scarcely touch the flesh now. M. de Bouganville,
in his voyage to the Falkland Islands, writes—‘We
had some of the porpoise served up at dinner the day
it was taken, which several others at the table besides
myself thought by no means so ill-tasted as it is
generally said to be.’</p>

<p>Porpoises are rather dangerous enemies to the shoals
of fish. A porpoise, before taking in a barrel of
herrings for its dinner, will often whet its appetite
with a cod’s head and shoulders, leaving the tail part
for some poor fisherman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c4">BIRDS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Leaving now our passing survey of the food supplies
derived from animals, we come next to birds, and, in the
first order, we do not find that any are eaten, at least,
as far as my knowledge extends; indeed, these carnivorous
birds, from their habits and their food, would
not be very tempting. This, however, as we have seen
in the case of predatory animals, is no safe criterion to
judge from. Probably, the man who would feast on the
flesh of a lion, or a polecat, would have a stomach
strong enough to digest slices of a John Crow carrion
vulture, an eagle, or a hawk.</p>

<p>In the order of <span class="smcap">Insessores</span>, or perching birds, I may
mention first—</p>

<p>The becafico, or fig-eater (<i>Sylvia hortensis</i>), a bird
about the size of a linnet, which is highly prized by the
Italians for the delicacy of its flesh, particularly in
autumn, when it is in excellent condition for the table.</p>

<p>There is a curious food product obtained, (not exactly,
however, from the bird,) which is in high repute in
China; and that is the edible nest of a species of swallow
extensively obtained in some of the islands of the
Eastern Archipelago.</p>

<p>These nests are attached to the sides of rocks like those
of our martin and swallow to walls, and look like so many
watch-pockets. The eggs are white, with a slight pinkish
tinge, and are generally two in number. The nests are
either white, red, or black, and the natives maintain
that these are built by three distinct species, with a
white, red, and black breast, but this is erroneous. The
Malays assert frequently, moreover, that the nests are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
formed from the bodies of certain sea snakes, but the
food is, without doubt, insects. The subjoined accounts
furnish the most detailed information known
respecting the collection and trade in these birdsnests.</p>

<p>The following description of the birdsnests’ rocks, in
the district of Karang Bollong, on the southerly sea-coast
of Java, is given in the first volume of the <i>Journal
of the Indian Archipelago</i>, published at Singapore.</p>

<p>‘The gathering of these nests takes place three times
a year—in the end of April, the middle of August, and
in December. The yearly produce is commonly between
50 and 60 piculs of 133⅓ lbs. The business of collection
is opened with great ceremony by the natives. By the
assistance of ladders and stages made of rattan, the collectors
descend the rocks and cliffs, provided with the
requisite bags to contain the nests, which are taken
from the wall by the hand, and those which are on the
roof by an iron hook made fast to a long bamboo. The
birds feed upon different kinds of bloodless insects,
hovering above the stagnant waters, for which their
wide open beak is very useful. They form their nests
by vomiting the strongest and best fragments of the
food which they have eaten. The nests are weighed
and packed in hampers (of 25 catties each), and labelled
with the net weight, mark of the overseer, &amp;c., and
then further preserved and secured with strips of bark,
leaves, and matting.</p>

<p>‘The edible birdsnests, which owe their celebrity
only to the whimsical luxury of the Chinese, are brought
principally from Java and Sumatra, though they are
found on most of the rocky islets of the Indian Archipelago.
The nest is the habitation of a small swallow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
named (from the circumstance of having an edible
house) <i>Hirundo esculenta</i>. They are composed of a
mucilaginous substance, but as yet they have never
been analyzed with sufficient accuracy to show the
constituents. Externally, they resemble ill-concocted,
fibrous isinglass, and are of a white colour, inclining to
red. Their thickness is little more than that of a silver
spoon, and the weight from a quarter to half an ounce.
When dry they are brittle and wrinkled; the size is
nearly that of a goose’s egg. Those that are dry,
white, and clean, are the most valuable. They are
packed in bundles, with split rattans run through them
to preserve the shape. Those procured after the young
are fledged, are not saleable in China. The quality of
the nest varies according to the situation and extent of
the caves, and the time at which they are taken. If
procured before the young are fledged, the nests are of
the best kind; if they contain eggs only, they are still
valuable; but if the young are in the nests, or have
left them, the whole are then nearly worthless, being
dark-coloured, streaked with blood, and intermixed
with feathers and dirt. These nests are procurable
twice every year; the best are found in deep, damp
caves, which, if not injured, will continue to produce
indefinitely. It was once thought that the caves near
the sea-coast were the most productive; but some of
the most profitable yet found are situated 50 miles in
the interior. This fact seems to be against the opinion
that the nests are composed of the spawn of fish, or of
<i>bêche-de-mer</i>. The method of procuring these nests is
not unattended with danger. Some of the caves are so
precipitous, that no one but those accustomed to the
employment from their youth can obtain the nests, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
only approachable by a perpendicular descent of many
hundred feet, by ladders of bamboo and rattan, over
a sea rolling violently against the rocks. When the
mouth of the cave is attained, the perilous task of taking
the nests must often be performed by torchlight, by
penetrating into recesses of the rock; where the slightest
slip would be instantly fatal to the adventurers, who
see nothing below them but the turbulent surf, making
its way into the chasms of the rock—such is the price
paid to gratify luxury. After the nests are obtained,
they are separated from feathers and dirt, are carefully
dried and packed, and are then fit for the market. The
Chinese, who are the only people that purchase them
for their own use, bring them in junks to this market,
where they command extravagant prices; the best, or
<i>white</i> kind, often being worth four thousand dollars per
picul (a Chinese weight, equal to 133⅓ lbs. avoirdupois),
which is nearly twice their weight in silver. The middling
kind is worth from twelve to eighteen hundred,
and the worst, or those procured after fledging, one
hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars per picul.
The majority of the best kind are sent to Pekin, for the
use of the court. It appears, therefore, that this curious
dish is only an article of expensive luxury amongst
the Chinese; the Japanese do not use it at all, and
how the former people acquired the habit of indulging
in it, is only less singular than their persevering in it.
They consider the edible birdsnest as a great stimulant,
tonic, and aphrodisiac, but its best quality, perhaps,
is its being perfectly harmless. The labour bestowed
to render it fit for the table is enormous; every feather,
stick, or impurity of any kind is carefully removed;
and then, after undergoing many washings and preparations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
it is made into a soft, delicious jelly. The sale
of birdsnests is a monopoly with all the governments
in whose dominions they are found. About two hundred
and fifty thousand piculs, of the value of one
million four hundred thousand dollars, are annually
brought to Canton. These come from the islands of
Java, Sumatra, Macassar, and those of the Sooloo group.
Java alone sends about thirty thousand pounds, mostly of
the first quality, estimated at seventy thousand dollars.’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Moor, in his notices of the <i>Indian Archipelago</i>,
published at Singapore some years ago,
states, that ‘one of the principal and most valuable
articles of exportation is the edible birdsnests, white
and black. These are found in much greater abundance
in and about the Coti, more than any other part
of Borneo, or from what we at present know on the
subject, all parts put together. On the western coast
they are scarcely known to exist; about Banjermassin
and Bagottan there are none; at Bataliching and Passier
they are found in considerable quantities. At Browe
there is abundance of the black kind of a very superior
quality, but little of the white. At Seboo, and all the
parts to the north of Borneo, we know there is none, as
I have seen many letters from different Rajahs of those
countries averring the fact, and begging the Sultan of
Coti to exchange his edible nests for their most valuable
commodities, and at his own price. Nor ought this
to create surprise, when we consider, not only the large
consumption of this article by the Cambojans, who almost
exclusively inhabit some of the largest Sooloo Islands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and the northern parts of Borneo, but the amazing
demand on the whole coast of Cambodia, particularly of
Cochin China, the principal inhabitants of which countries
are as partial to this luxury as their more northern
neighbours—the Chinese. There are in Coti and adjacent
Dyak countries perhaps eighty known places, or
what the natives term holes, which produce the white
nests. I have seen the names of forty-three. There
can, however, be no doubt there are many more likewise
known to the Dyaks, who keep the knowledge to themselves,
lest the Bugis should dispossess them, which
they know from experience is invariably the case.</p>

<p>‘According to the accounts of the Sultan, rendered
by Saib Abdulla, the bandarree in 1834 yielded
134 piculs. The usual price in money to the Coti
traders is 23 reals per catty from the Dyaks, and 25
in barter. The black nests may be procured in great
abundance. The best kinds come from Cinculeram
and Baley Papang. The latter mountain alone yields
230 piculs (of 113⅓ lbs.). Cinculeram gives nearly
as much. There are several other parts of Coti which
produce them, besides the quantity brought down by the
Dyaks. Last year, 130 piculs paid duty to the Sultan;
these left the large Coti river. Those from Cinculeram
and Bongan were taken to Browe and Seboo. The
bandarree’s book averages the annual weight of those
collected in the lower part of Coti at 820 piculs (about
1,025 cwts.)</p>

<p>‘The Pangeran Sierpa and the Sultan say they could
collect 2,700 piculs of black nests, if the bandarree and
capella-campong would behave honestly. The Sultan,
however, seldom gets any account of what is sent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Browe, Seboo, and the Sooloo Islands, the quality of
which is far superior to any sent to European ports.’</p>

<p>The exports of birdsnests from Java, between 1823
and 1832, averaged about 250 piculs a year; in 1832,
322 piculs; but of late years the exports have not
averaged half that amount; and in 1853 and 1854 there
were only about 35 or 40 piculs shipped.</p>

<p>In the third order, <span class="smcap">Scansores</span>, there are very few
edible birds.</p>

<p>In the mountain of Tumeriquiri, in the government
of Cumana, is the immense cavern of Guacharo, famous
among the Indians. It serves as a habitation for
millions of nocturnal birds (<i>Steatornis caripensis</i>, a new
species of the <i>Caprimulgis</i>, of Linnæus), whose fat
yields the oil of Guacharo.</p>

<p>Once a year, near midsummer, this cavern is entered
by the Indians. Armed with poles, they ransack the
greater part of the nests, while the old birds hover over
the heads of the robbers as if to defend their brood,
uttering horrible cries. The young which fall down
are opened on the spot. The peritoneum is found
loaded with fat, and a layer of the same substance
reaches from the abdomen to the vent, forming a kind of
cushion between the hind legs. Humboldt remarks
that this quantity of fat in frugivorous animals, not exposed
to the light, and exerting but little muscular
motion, brings to mind what has been long observed in
the fattening of geese and oxen. ‘It is well known,’ he
adds, ‘how favourable darkness and repose are to this
process.’</p>

<p>At the period above mentioned, which is generally
known at Carissa by the designation of ‘the oil harvest,’
huts are built by the Indians, with palm leaves, near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
the entrance and even in the very porch of the cavern.
There the fat of the young birds just killed is melted in
clay pots, over a brushwood fire, and this fat is named
butter or oil of the Guacharo. It is half liquid, transparent,
inodorous, and so pure that it will keep above
a year without turning rancid.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>There is a curious bird met with in caves in the West
India Islands—as at Dominica, and the gulf of Paria,
the diablotin or goat-sucker, which, if eaten when taken
from the nest, is pronounced by epicures unrivalled;
and the flesh is also considered a delicacy when salted.</p>

<p>It has received its popular cognomen from its ugliness,
but I have not been able to trace its scientific name.</p>

<p>The bird is nearly the size of a duck, and web-footed,
with a big round head and crooked bill like a
hawk, and large full eyes like an owl; the head, part of
the neck, and chief feathers of the wing and tail, are
black, while the other parts of its body are covered with
a fine milk-white down; the whole appearance being
very singular. The diablotin only leaves its haunts at
night time, flying with hideous screams like the owl,
which it resembles in its dislike to day-light. The
nests are made in holes in the mountains. When the
palms are in fruit, the bird becomes one lump of fat.
The hideous appearance of the bird and the strong scent
once got over, it is said to be a delicious morsel.</p>

<p>We have our delicate tit-bits in spitted larks, and as
many as four thousand dozen have been known to be
taken in the neighbourhood of Dunstable between September
and February. What the number sold in our
metropolitan markets is annually, it is impossible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
say. But larks are taken in much larger numbers in
Germany, where there is an excise upon them, which
has yielded as much as £1,000 a year in Leipsic—the
larks of which place are famous all over Germany as
being of a most delicate flavour.</p>

<p>In the Italian markets, besides carrion crows, strings
of thrushes, larks, and even robin redbreasts are sold.</p>

<p>Young rooks, when skinned and made into pies are
much esteemed by some persons, but they are very
coarse eating.</p>

<p>One of the most delicious birds is the rice-bunting
of South Carolina (<i>Dolichonyx oryzivorus</i>).</p>

<p>The rice-bunting migrates over the continent of
America, from Labrador to Mexico, and over the great
Antilles, appearing in the southern extremity of the
United States about the end of March. Towards the
middle and close of August, they enter New York, and
Pennsylvania on their way to the south. There, along
the shores of the large rivers lined with floating fields
of wild rice, they find abundant subsistence, grow fat,
and their flesh becomes little inferior in flavour to that
of the European ortolan, on which account the reed, or
rice birds, as they are then called, are shot in great numbers.
When the cool nights in October commence, they
move still farther south, till they reach the islands of
Jamaica and Cuba in prodigious numbers to feed on the
seeds of the guinea grass. Epicures compare the plump
and juicy flesh of this delicacy to the ortolan.</p>

<p>On the shores of the Mediterranean there are feathered
delicacies in the shape of the quail and the ortolan.
Thousands of ortolans used to be shipped from the
island of Cyprus, packed in casks of 300 or 400, prepared
with spice and vinegar. When specially fattened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
for the table, they are regarded as most delicious; but,
being merely lumps of fat, are so rich as soon to satiate
the appetite of even a professed gourmand. In the
West India Islands and the Southern States of America,
the rice-bunting, as we have seen, takes its place, and is,
occasionally, found in prodigious numbers, and greatly
esteemed.</p>

<p>The bluish flesh of the toucan, notwithstanding its
enormous and unsightly beak, is a wholesome and delicate
meat; and there are no birds that give the Trinidad
epicure a more delicious morsel. It is one of the most
omnivorous of birds, and its powers of digestion and
impunity to poisons are remarkable.</p>

<p>Parrot pie is said to be pretty good; at least, it may
be so when other animal food is scarce.</p>

<p>Among the <span class="allsmcap">GALLINACEOUS</span> fowls, large numbers contribute
to the food delicacies of man. Some, like the
turkey, peacock, &amp;c., of considerable size; others, as the
pigeon tribe, form smaller tit-bits.</p>

<p>The game birds, the pheasant, partridge, grouse, &amp;c.,
and the quail, guinea fowl, and jungle fowl, are bagged
whenever they can be obtained by the sportsman.</p>

<p>The peacock enkakyll ‘was one of the famous dishes
at the costly royal banquets of old, and the receipt for
dressing it is thus given:—</p>

<p>‘Take and flay off the skin with the feathers, tail, and
the neck and head thereon; then take the skin and all
the feathers and lay it on the table abroad, and strew
thereon ground cumin; then take the peacock and
roast him, and baste him with raw yolks of eggs; and
when he is roasted, take him off and let him cool awhile,
then take him and sew him in his skin, and gild his
comb, and so serve him forth with the last course.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>As far as my own experience goes, with all the basting
and sauces, the peacock is, at best, a dry and tough
eating bird.</p>

<p>The domestic fowls and the tame turkey require no
notice here, there being nothing curious about them,
however delicate eating they may be when properly
fattened and brought to table; but there is a species of
wild turkey found in New Granada, weighing from 12
to 16 lbs., and called the iowanen, which is described by
Mr. W. Purdie of Trinidad as the most delicate article
of food he ever tasted.</p>

<p>Dear as fowls, ducks, and eggs comparatively are,
they meet, as every one knows, with a ready sale.
When we find our imports of eggs, chiefly from France,
amount to about 130,000,000 a year, besides our nominal
‘new laid,’ or home produce,—when we learn that
the foreign poultry we receive (mixed up with not a
few Ostend rabbits) is valued at 39,000<i>l.</i>, and that
Ireland supplies us with about 150,000,000 of eggs, we
begin to perceive that fowls, ducks, geese, and turkeys
must be a profitable investment to some persons, and
the capital of about 4,000,000<i>l.</i> we lay out on these
various products serves to gladden the heart of many
a poultry breeder.</p>

<p>There are sent to market about nine or ten million
head of poultry in a year to supply the whole population
of the United Kingdom, shipping and all, which
is not more than one-third of a fowl to each person
annually. Now, were every one to have a fowl as part
food once a month, it would require 330,000,000 more
fowls or other poultry than are at present sold.</p>

<p>I copy the following from what I believe to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
first fixed tariff of provisions, in the City of London,
about the second year of Edward I. (1272.) The
people had at that time great cause to complain of the
exorbitant prices demanded of them for provisions,
by hucksters and dealers, and a fixed price was found
necessary by the Mayor:—</p>

<p>We are not quite such prodigious devourers of eggs
as our French neighbours, having a greater amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of meat or solid animal food to fall back upon, and fewer
fast days. Another reason is, that we cannot, like the
French, get them so fresh and cheap; but as an alimentary
substance, eggs are always in demand at a ratio
proportionate to the prices at which they can be obtained.
In Paris the consumption of eggs is at least
175 per annum to every head of the population; in the
departments it is more than double that amount; eggs
entering into almost every article of food, and butchers’
meat being scarce and dear. If we only use, in London,
half the number of eggs the Parisians do, there must be
a sale of about 173 millions a year; and the consumption
throughout the kingdom would be fully 2,000 millions.
Although smaller in size, and not equal to a
new-laid egg, the French eggs arrive in pretty good
condition, and, if sold off quickly, are well adapted for
ordinary culinary purposes. Few are wasted, for even
when not very fresh, they are sold for frying fish, and
to the lower class of confectioners for pastry. Fried
eggs, boiled eggs chopped up with salad, egg sauce for
fish, &amp;c., eggs for puddings, for omelets, and pancakes,
all contribute to the sale. Omelets, sweet or flavoured
with herbs, are much less patronized in this
country than they are in France.</p>

<p>The sixty wholesale egg merchants and salesmen
in the metropolis, whose itinerant carts are kept constantly
occupied in distributing their brittle ware, might
probably enlighten us as to the extent and increasing
character of the trade, and the remunerative nature of
the profits. Railways and steamers bring up large
crates, and carefully packed boxes of eggs, for the ravenous
maws of young and old, who fatten on this
dainty and easily digested food. The various city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
markets dispose of two millions of fowls, one million of
game birds, half a million of ducks, and about one hundred
and fifty thousand turkeys, every year. But even
if we doubled this supply, what would it be among the
three million souls of the great metropolis requiring
daily food.</p>

<p>Ireland and the continent contribute largely to our
supply of poultry and eggs. Immense pens of poultry,
purchased in the Irish market, are shipped by the
steamers to Glasgow and Liverpool. Commerce owes
much to the influence of steam, but agriculture is no
less indebted to the same power. Taking everything
into account, and examining all the advantages derived
by cheap and rapid transit, the manufacturer of food is
quite as much indebted to the steam-ship and the locomotive
as the manufacturer of clothing.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty whatever in testing eggs; they
are mostly examined by a candle. Another way to tell
good eggs is to put them in a pail of water, and if they
are good they will <i>lie on their sides</i>, always; if bad,
they will stand on their small ends, the large ends
always uppermost, unless they have been shaken considerably,
when they will stand either end up. Therefore,
a bad egg can be told by the way it rests in water—always
end up, never on its side. Any egg that lies
flat is good to eat, and can be depended upon.</p>

<p>An ordinary mode is to take them into a room
moderately dark and hold them between the eye and a
candle or lamp. If the egg be good—that is, if the
albumen is still unaffected—the light will shine through
with a reddish glow; while, if affected, it will be
opaque, or dark.</p>

<p>In Fulton and Washington market, New York, a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
may be seen testing eggs at almost any time of the year.
He has a tallow candle placed under a counter or desk,
and taking up the eggs, three in each hand, passes them
rapidly before the candle, and deposits them in another
box. His practised eye quickly perceives the least want
of clearness in the eggs, and suspicious ones are re-examined
and thrown away, or passed into a ‘doubtful’
box. The process is so rapid that eggs are inspected
perfectly at the rate of 100 to 200 per minute, or as fast
as they can be shifted from one box to another, six at
a time.</p>

<p>The preservation of eggs for use on ship board has
always occupied a large share of attention. They have
been usually smeared with oil or grease, and packed in
bran or sawdust. A plan recommended by M. Appert
for preserving eggs is to put them in a jar with bran, to
prevent their breaking; cork and hermetically seal the
jar; and put it into a vessel of water, heated to 200 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 12 degrees below boiling. The
vessel with water being taken from the fire, the water
must cool till the finger may be borne in it; then
remove the jar. The eggs may then be taken out, and
will keep for six months.</p>

<p>Salted ducks’ eggs are an article in great demand in
some parts of the East, for transport by the trading
junks. The Malays salt them as they do their meat;
but the Chinese mix a red unctuous earth with the brine,
which no doubt stops the pores of the shell, and preserves
them better. They are put into this mixture at
night, and taken out during the day to be dried in the
sun, which is, in fact, a half roasting process in a
tropical climate.</p>

<p>Pickled eggs, while they constitute a somewhat novel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
feature in the catalogue of condiments, are at the same
time particularly relishing. When eggs are plentiful,
farmers’ wives, in some localities, take four to six dozen
of such as are newly laid, and boil them hard; then,
divesting them of the shells, they place them in large-mouthed
earthen jars, and pour upon them scalded
vinegar, well seasoned with whole pepper, allspice,
ginger, and a few cloves of garlic. When this pickle
is cold, the jars are closed, and the eggs are fit for use
in a month afterwards. Eggs thus treated are held in
high esteem by all the farm-house epicures.</p>

<p>Fowls’ eggs, variously coloured, and having flowers
and other matters upon them, formed by the colouring
matter being picked off so as to expose the white shell
of the egg, are a part of all the Malay entertainments
in Borneo. The eggs eaten by the Dyaks are frequently
nearly hatched when taken from the nest, as they enjoy
them just as well as when fresh.</p>

<p>An article called ‘condensed egg’ is now sold in the
shops. It consists of the whole substance of the fresh
uncooked egg, very delicately and finely granulated by
patent processes, after the watery particles, which the
egg naturally contains, have been completely exhausted
and withdrawn, without further alteration of its constituents.
It contains all the nutritious properties of
the egg in its natural state, and must be valuable to
shipmasters, emigrants, and others. One ounce of it is
said to be equal to three eggs.</p>

<p>The ancient Romans, though not great beef-eaters,
were particular as to poultry. Dr. Daubeny, in his
<i>Lectures on Roman Husbandry</i>, says—‘The ancient
Romans had large preserves, not only of poultry and
pigeons, but even of thrushes and quails enclosed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
pens which were called ‘ornithones,’ from which they
could draw their supply for the table at pleasure. We
are told, indeed, of two sorts of ornithones, the one
merely aviaries stocked with birds for the amusement
of the proprietor; the other kind, constructed with a
view to profit, which were often of vast extent, to
supply the demands of the Roman market for such
articles of luxury. In the Sabine country particularly,
we read of extensive pens, filled with birds for the
latter purpose. For thrushes alone there were large
rooms provided, each capable of holding several thousand
birds. As they were put in to be fattened, the
place had only just light enough to enable the birds to
see their food, but there was a good supply of fresh
water accessible. And I may remark that, whilst
nothing is said by the Roman writers about the fattening
of oxen and sheep, particular directions are given
for fattening poultry and other birds—a strong additional
argument of the little importance they attached
to the larger animals as articles of food.’</p>

<p>The following may be enumerated as the sportsman’s
game in Jamaica:—</p>

<p>1. The pintado, or wild guinea fowl (<i>Numida Meleagris</i>),
a bird now domesticated in our poultry-yards.
In its wild state the flesh is considered by many
persons to equal that of the pheasant.</p>

<p>2. The quail (<i>Perdix coturnix</i>).</p>

<p>3. Wild pigeons, namely, ring-tail, bald-pate, pea-dove,
white-breast, white-wing, mountain-witch, ground
dove, and red-legged partridge.</p>

<p>4. Snipe (<i>Scolopax gallinago</i>).</p>

<p>5. Wild duck, or mallard (<i>Anas boschas</i>).</p>

<p>6. Gray, or Gadwall duck (<i>Anas strepera</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>7. The common teal (<i>Anas crecca</i>), the flesh of which
was so much prized by the Roman epicures, and is still
in request for the table.</p>

<p>8. Widgeon (<i>Anas Penelope</i>).</p>

<p>9. Gray and ring plover (<i>Charadrius minor</i>, and
<i>hiaticula</i>).</p>

<p>If we are out shooting in Canada we may easily add
to our mess the ruffled grouse (<i>Tetrao umbellus</i>),
although these, like many other birds, are partridges
with the settlers—this variety being termed the birch
partridge. Another species, the spruce partridge of
the colonists (<i>T. Canadensis</i>), is less palatable, for,
unfortunately, it has a habit of feeding upon laurel
leaves. But here is something to make amends—a fine
Esquimaux curlew, as large as an English partridge,
and a mud-sucker, <i>id est</i> snipe.</p>

<p>Let me note a Canadian receipt for cooking a partridge,
which may be useful to sportsmen and travellers:—</p>

<p>‘Expedition is the maxim of all sylvan cookery, and
as plucking the feathers of a partridge would be too
great a tax on the time and patience of the voyageur,
the method most in vogue is to run your hunting knife
round his throat and ancles and down his breast, when,
taking a leg in each hand, and pressing your thumb
into his back, you pop him out of his skin, as you
would a pea from its pod. Then make a spread-eagle
of him on a forked twig, the other extremity of which is
thrust into the ground, and after wrapping a rasher of
bacon around his neck and under his wings, as ladies
wear a scarf, you incline him to the fire, turning the
spit in the ground, and you will have a result such as
Soyer might be proud of. When your other avocations
will not afford time even for the skinning process, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
alternative mode is to make a paste of ashes and water, and
roll up your bird therein, with the feathers, and all the appurtenances
thereof, and thrust the performance in the
fire. In due time, on breaking the cemented shell (which is
like a sugared almond), the feathers, skin, &amp;c., adhere to
it, and then you have the pure kernel of poultry within.’</p>

<p>The red-legged partridge is common in the Greek
islands, on the continent of Asia, and in the southern
countries of Europe. In some of the Cyclades, where
the inhabitants are too poor to expend money on powder,
they chase the birds on foot, till they are so wearied, as
to be easily taken with the hand.</p>

<p>Of all the European birds, the quail (<i>Coturnix
vulgaris</i>) is the most remarkable, on account of the
vast numbers which congregate on the shores of the
Mediterranean in the spring, coming from Asia Minor
and Northern Africa, to avoid the excessive heat. For
a few weeks in the month of April, when they first begin
to arrive in Sicily, everybody is a sportsman. Arriving
always in the night, although not a quail could be
seen the evening before, the report of guns the next
morning, in all directions, attests their number and the
havoc that has begun upon them. Such prodigious
numbers have appeared on the western coasts of the
kingdom of Naples, that a hundred thousand have been
taken in a day, within the space of four or five miles.</p>

<p>The flesh of the turtle dove is considered much superior
to that of the wild pigeon.</p>

<p>The passenger pigeon (<i>Columba migratoria</i>) of America,
is a very large and well flavoured variety, being
16 inches long, and 24 inches in the spread of its wings;
its hue chiefly slate-colour. They migrate at certain
seasons in millions, and feed on acorns and fresh mast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
They travel in the morning and evening, and repose
about mid-day in the forests. Their passage, whether
in spring or autumn, lasts from 15 to 20 days, after
which they are met with in the centre of the United
States. The Indians often watch the roosting places of
these birds, and knocking them on the head in the
night, bring them away by thousands. They preserve
the oil or fat, which they use instead of butter. There
was formerly scarcely any little Indian village in the
interior, where a hundred gallons of this oil might not
at any time be purchased.</p>

<p>These pigeons spread over the whole of North America,
abounding round Hudson’s Bay, where they remain
till December. They arrive in the fur countries in the
latter end of May, and depart in October. They are
met with as far south as the Gulf of Mexico, but do
not extend their range westward of the Rocky Mountains.
Stray passenger pigeons have been taken both in
Norway and in Russia; and this bird has found a place in
the British fauna, from a solitary bird having been shot
in Westhall, Fifeshire, on the 31st December, 1825.
Like other pigeons, this genus makes a slender platform
nest of sticks and straws, but, unlike other pigeons,
prolific as it is, it lays but one egg. The female builds the
nest, the male bird fetches the materials. The time of
incubation is 16 days, and the male relieves the female
in sitting during that period. The immense number
of these birds baffles all computation. Those eminent
ornithologists, Wilson and Audubon, describe flocks seen
by them to contain respectively from thousands of millions
to upwards of a billion in each, the daily food required
to sustain which would be at least 60,000 bushels;
and the New York <i>Evening Post</i> informs us that, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
one day, seven tons of these pigeons were brought into
the New York market by the Erie railroad.</p>

<p>In their breeding places, herds of hogs are fed on the
young pigeons or ‘squabs,’ which are also melted down
by the settlers, as a substitute for butter or lard. The
felling a single tree often produces 200 squabs, nearly
as large as the old ones, and almost one mass of fat.
When the flocks of full grown pigeons enter a district,
clap-nets and guns are in great requisition. Pennant,
in his <i>Arctic Zoology</i>, says, Sir William Johnstone told
him, that at one shot, he brought down with a blunderbuss
above a hundred and twenty pigeons. Wagon
loads of them are poured into the towns, and sold as
cheap as a half-penny up to two-pence the dozen. The
flesh tastes like the common wild blue pigeon, but is,
if anything, better flavoured. Why (it has been asked)
could not this large pigeon, whose migratory habits are
principally caused by search for food, be introduced
into this country as a tame variety, or by crossing with
our native breeds enlarge the size; or, in the same way
as fresh mutton was sent from Australia, be sent in
casks potted in their own fat, to supply us with cheap
pigeon pies? And the same with a cross with the large
Texan rabbit, or the wild American turkey, the latter
being far superior in size and appearance to its degenerate
descendant, the tame turkey, sometimes as much
as four feet in length, and five feet from wing to wing?
The canvas-back ducks of America are there boasted
of exceedingly as a delicacy, yet, although a great
variety of useless water-fowl has been introduced
merely as an ornament to the ponds and streams of our
gentry, no attempt has been made to bring this kind to
our farm-yards and tables; and even if it was found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
impossible to tame the pure breed, a cross with our
own might be effected. In the capercailzie, or <i>cock of
the wood</i>, a bird of the grouse species, but nearly as
large as a turkey, once indigenous to Scotland, but now
only found in the north of Europe, and in the <i>bustard</i>,
the largest European land-bird, the cock weighing from
25 to 27 lbs., we have examples of two fowls well worth
the trial of domesticating by the amateur or intelligent
agriculturist, a trial which, if successful, would probably
repay quite as well as competition about the colour
of a feather, or the shortness of a tail, and in time would
be the means of affording a constant, certain, and moderately-priced
supply, which is never the case while
animals remain in a wild or half-wild state.</p>

<p>Although the forests of New Zealand are not thickly
inhabited by the feathered tribes, there are many birds
to be met with. Among others are the following, which
are excellent eating.—The wild pigeon, which is very
large and common; the parrot or ka-ka; and the <i>tui</i> or
mocking bird, which is about the size of the English
black-bird, and of the same colour, but with two
bunches of white feathers under the neck—his notes are
few, but very melodious, resembling the tinkling of
small bells, which harmonize together as they are
delivered. The bronze-winged pigeon of Australia is
most delicate eating. It abounds in summer, when the
acacia seeds are ripe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5">GRALLATORES.</h2>
</div>


<p>From the order of grallatores, waders or stilt-birds,
we find many which yield choice dainties, whether it
be the ostrich or emu for their eggs, the bustard and
bittern, the flamingo for its tongue, the plover, dotterel,
curlew, snipe, woodcock, rail, &amp;c., for the table.</p>

<p>An ostrich egg is considered as equal in its contents
to 24 of the domestic hen. When taken fresh from the
nest, they are very palatable, and are wholesome, though
somewhat heavy food. The best mode of cooking them
is that practised by the Hottentots, who place one end
of the egg in the hot ashes, and making a small orifice
at the other, keep stirring the contents with a stick till
they are sufficiently roasted; and thus, with a seasoning
of salt and pepper, you have a very nice omelet.
The nest sometimes contains as many as 24 eggs, and
the difficulty the sportsman has is how to carry away
his spoil. The usual plan is to denude himself of his
upper or lower garments, and, tying up the orifices of
leg-holes or arm-holes, to make an impromptu sack, in
which he can bear away his prize. If he leaves them,
he will be sure to find on his return that the ostrich has
broken the eggs, because they have been disturbed.</p>

<p>The eggs of the emu of South America are large,
and, although the food which they afford is coarse, it is
not unpalatable.</p>

<p>The emu, or New Holland cassowary, is becoming
rarer as settlements advance. The same remark applies
also to the kangaroo and other animals against whom a
war of extermination seems to have been declared.</p>

<p>The emu is easily domesticated when taken young,
and becomes very familiar with, and attached to, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
dogs, which generally leads to the death of a tame one.
A full-grown one, when erect, stands seven feet high.
The natives creep on them and spear them. The eggs
are of a tea green colour, with a watered appearance
on the surface. There is a singularity in the growth
of the feathers—two of them spring from one quill.
The bird is principally valued for its oil. The skin of
a full-grown bird produces six or seven quarts of oil,
clear, and of a beautiful bright yellow colour. The
method of extracting or ‘trying’ out the oil is to pluck
the feathers, cut the skin into pieces, and boil it; but
the aborigines prefer the flesh with the skin upon it,
regarding it as the Esquimaux do the flesh of whales and
seals, as a highly luscious treat. The flesh is eaten by
Europeans, and preferred by some to the kangaroo; the
rump part is considered as delicate as fowl; the legs
coarser, like beef, but still tender.</p>

<p>Bustards are plentiful in many parts of the Cape
Colony, and the smaller sorts, called <i>koerhans</i>, are approachable
in a bush country; but the larger kinds,
called <i>paws</i>, are a great prize, as they are found on
plains, and are generally shot with ball. In Australia,
the bustard is called, colonially, the wild turkey. It
is a fine large bird, frequently weighing 12 to 15 lbs.,
and extending full six feet, from tip to tip of the wings.
There it is declared excellent for eating, but its flesh is
much too gamey for ordinary palates.</p>

<p>Don Pernetty, in his <i>Historical Journal of the
Voyage to the Falkland Islands</i>, under the command of
M. de Bouganville, says, they found the bustard ‘exquisite
either boiled, roasted, or fricasseed. It appeared
from the account we kept that we ate 1,500. It is,
indeed, hardly to be conceived that the ship’s company
of our two frigates, consisting of a hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
men, all in perfect health and with good stomachs,
should have found a quantity of these birds sufficient
for their subsistence during a stay of more than two
months, within a tract of country not exceeding three
leagues.’</p>

<p>But they also tried other descriptions of feathered
game. The wild ducks were found, in general, to
have the taste of mussels. Of a kind of grey goose,
weighing about 19 or 20 lbs., it is reported: ‘Its
flesh was oily, had a disagreeable smell and a fenny
taste; but it was eaten by the ships’ companies when
no bustards were given them.’</p>

<p>The clucking hen of Jamaica (<i>Ardea scolopacea</i>), on
the authority of Browne and Robinson, is looked upon
as the best wild fowl in the country, although the latter
writer tells us it feeds upon snakes, toads, and lizards,
as well as wood snails and gully crabs. The flavour is,
however, represented to be remarkably fine—a compound
of ham, partridge, and pigeon. The flesh is of a
peculiarly close and compact texture, and very tender.</p>

<p>The mangrove hen (<i>Rallus Virginianus</i>), indigenous
to the watery marshes of Jamaica, greatly resembles the
dappled grey variety of the common fowl. At the pullet
age, the young birds are run down, when feeding on the
mud, with great facility. At this time, I have found
them to be delicious eating. Persons, on whose taste
reliance may be placed, say that, though a plover be
undoubtedly a fine bird for the table, and the sanderling
a great delicacy, the young mangrove hen exceeds both,
as it combines all their peculiarity of flavour with the
fleshiness of the quail. This is no small commendation.
But much depends upon your <i>cuisinier</i>; if he is a good
<i>artiste</i>—a man of undoubted talents, it matters little
what the materials be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Rallus crex</i> is another esteemed dainty of no
ordinary kind, and a most delicious bird.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry the Eighth, the bittern was
held in great esteem at the tables of the great. Its
flesh has much the flavour of hare, and is far from
being unpleasant.</p>

<p>Snipe of all kinds, from the ‘teeterer,’ that hovers
about the edge of the surf, to the jack snipe (<i>Scolopax
gallinula</i>), half-brother to the woodcock, are in high
esteem for the table. The ‘green’ sportsman finds
these birds the most perplexing of all feathered game
when on the wing. Their catter-cornered, worm-fence
line of flight renders them very difficult to hit, until
long practice has rendered the marksman’s eye familiar
with their erratic movements. Some sportsmen take
them at an angle; others after they have made their
tack; and others, again, seem to blaze away at them
without any particular aim, and yet always bring down
their bird. The yellow-legged snipe is in America
considered the best species for the table. They should
be larded and roasted in bunches of three, and served
in gravy made from their own unctuous drippings.
There are few side-dishes more popular with epicures
than snipe on toast. Some cooks stuff them with a
composition of bread crumbs and egg, highly seasoned;
but, in my opinion, they are far better without this
kind of ‘trimmings.’</p>

<p>While the trail of the woodcock is a choice morsel
with the English epicure, the inhabitants of the North of
Europe, to whose forests the woodcocks retire in the
summer, never eat the birds, esteeming their flesh unwholesome,
from the circumstance of their having no
crops. But they are particularly fond of the eggs,
which the boors offer for sale in large quantities in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
principal markets, and this contributes, possibly, to
make the birds so scarce.</p>

<p>The semi-palmated snipe, better known by its common
sobriquet of ‘pill-will-willet,’ the loud shrill note
which it emits, is at certain periods of the year esteemed
an excellent bird in America. It ought to be served
up in the mode that snipes usually are, and for these
delicious viands it is esteemed a tolerable substitute
when in good order.</p>

<p>Dampier, nearly two centuries ago, speaking of
the flamingo, says: ‘Their flesh is lean and black, but
not ill-tasted. They have large tongues, and near the
root of them a piece of fat, which is accounted a great
dainty.’</p>

<p>The flamingo was much esteemed by the Romans at
their sumptuous entertainments. Their flesh is thought
tolerably good food, and the tongue was looked upon by
the ancients as among the most delicate of all eatables.
Pliny, Martial, and many other writers, speak of it in
the highest terms of commendation. Many who have
tried it, consider the flesh extremely rich, much like
that of the wild duck, but with a strong fishy taste.
The tongue is certainly delicate, but scarcely worthy
the high encomiums bestowed on it by the ancients.</p>

<p>During the surveying expedition of Captain Owen,
on the east coast of Africa, the sailors used to shoot
hundreds of these beautiful birds for the purpose of
making a dish of the tongues alone. The remainder of
the bird—in imitation of the Roman epicures—being
thrown away.</p>
<hr class="full x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c6">NATATORES.</h2>
</div>


<p>The Natatores, or swimming birds, supply us with
very choice food. Even many of the coarse sea fowl are
not rejected by voyagers.</p>

<p>The Chinese shoot sea-gulls in large numbers, which
add to their stock of food. A man is constantly engaged
in the bay of San Francisco, California, shooting sea-gulls,
which he sells to the Chinese at the rate of 25 cents each.
The <i>San Francisco Evening News</i> says,—‘This bird is a
slow and steady mover, of large size, and flies at a convenient
distance over the head of the sportsman. The man
in the skiff was armed with a double-barrelled shot gun,
both barrels of which he would load, and taking a dead
gull would throw it high in the air and allow it to fall
at some distance from the boat. This would naturally
attract a flock of gulls, and as they made their slow
circuit around the spot, the gunner raised his piece and
generally succeeded in bringing down a bird for both
barrels. He would then re-load as fast as possible,
and if a gull was in range, another shot was fired and
another trophy won.’</p>

<p>The flesh of sea-fowl is generally too rancid to find
much favour with fastidious palates. Sailors indeed
eat the livers and hearts of the penguins, which are exceedingly
palatable, but the black flesh of the body is
rank and oily, and has rather a perfumed taste. Some
voyagers, however, tell us, that eaten in ragouts, they
are good as that made from a hare.</p>

<p>The young puffins, having gorged themselves with
sprats and crustacea, when pickled with spices, are by
some considered dainties, and they are, occasionally,
potted in the North. But when it has attained its ugly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
full developed bill, like a short, thick plough coulter,
this bird does not look very prepossessing. Besides
making use of them for food, some of the islanders use
them for fire-wood. They split them open, dry them,
and then burn them feathers and all.</p>

<p>There is a species of puffin, the <i>Puffinus urinatrix</i>
or <i>P. brevicaudis</i>, popularly termed the mutton-bird by
Tasmanian colonists, which is met with on some of the
New Zealand islands. It forms the principal food
for the native inhabitants of Foveaux Straits, and by
them is called the <i>titi</i>. It is a sea bird of black colour,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
in its usual condition smaller than the common duck.
Like all sea birds it has thin, slender legs, with webbed
feet: the wings are long, with many joints, I forget
how many: the bill is a little hooked at the point.
They are generally in large flocks, covering the ocean
as far as the eye can reach; sometimes flying all in the
same direction, at other times crossing through each
other like swarming bees. They breed on the small
uninhabited islands scattered round the coasts of Stewart’s
Island. These islands have a loose, dry, peatish
soil, on a stony bottom. Their being exposed to the
stormy winds, loaded with the salt spray of the sea,
prevents the growth of a forest, except patches of
stunted bushes intermixed with a sort of soft, light
green fern. The loose soil is perforated with numberless
birdholes, like a piece of worm-eaten wood, running
from two to four feet underground in a horizontal direction,
at the farthest end of which is the nest. Each
female lays only one egg, which is nearly as big as a
goose egg, on which they sit—it is believed male and
female alternately—many weeks. The young bird is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
full grown in the month of April, which corresponds to
October in Europe. At that time, almost all the inhabitants
of Foveaux Straits, old and young—the infirm
only excepted—repair to the Titi Islands, and take the
young birds out of their nests, which amount to many
thousands, and a great many still escape. They put a
stick in the hole to feel where the bird is, which
generally betrays itself by biting the stick. If the hole
is so long that the bird cannot be reached by the hand, a
hole is dug over it, the bird taken out and killed by
breaking its head, and the broken hole covered with
rubbish and earth, so that it may be used again the next
year. Afterwards the birds are plucked, and, to clean
the skin from the hairy down, it is moistened and held
over the fire, when it is easily wiped quite clean. Then
the neck, wings, and legs are cut off, the breast is opened,
the entrails are taken out, and the body is laid flat,
either to be salted or to be boiled in its own fat, and
preserved in air-tight kelp bags. Though it cannot be
said that the young birds suffer, they being killed so
quickly, yet it might seem cruel to rob the parents of
their young ones on so large a scale, and one would
fancy a great deal of fluttering and screaming of the old
ones, bewailing the bereavement of their offspring. But
that is not the case. None of the old birds make their
appearance in the day-time. They are all out at sea,
and come only to their nests in the evening when it gets
dark, and are off again at day-break. But yet it would
seem the parents would be distressed at finding their
nests robbed. Not so. It would seem as if Providence
had ordered it so that man should go and take the
young birds for his food without hurting the feelings
of the parents. When the young birds are full grown,
then they are neglected by their parents, in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
starve them to get thin, else they would never be able
to fly for the heaviness of their fat. It seems that at
the time when they are taken by men, they are already
forsaken by the old birds; and those that are not taken
are compelled by hunger, when they have been starved
thin and light, to leave their holes and go to sea. The
old birds are tough and lean, but the young ones, which
are nearly twice as big, contain, when the legs, wings,
neck, and entrails are taken off, three-fourths of pure
white fat, and one-fourth of red meat and tender bones.
The flavour is rather fishy, but, if once used to it, not
bad at all, only rather too fat. They eat best when
salted and smoked a little, and then boiled a short time,
and afterwards eaten cold. If properly salted, they
might make an article of trade, like herrings in
Europe. The fat when clean is quite white, and looks
just like goose fat, but the taste is rather oily; however,
it may be used for a good many other purposes than for
food. It burns very well on small shallow tin lamps,
which get warmed by the light and melt the fat. The
feathers are very soft, and would make excellent beds if
they could be cured of the oily smell, which it is likely
they can.</p>

<p>The following remarks on the articles of food found
in the arctic regions are by one of the officers of the
<i>Assistance</i>:—</p>

<p>‘To the feathered tribe we are chiefly indebted, and
foremost in the list for flavour and delicacy of fibre
stand the ptarmigan (<i>Lagopus mutus</i>) and the willow
grouse (<i>Tetrao saliceti</i>). The flesh is dark-coloured,
and has somewhat the flavour of the hare. These may
be used in pie, stewed, boiled, or roast, at pleasure, and
are easily shot. Next in gustatory joys, the small birds
rank, a kind of snipe, and a curlew sandpiper; both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
are, however, rarely met with, and do not repay the
trouble of procuring them.</p>

<p>‘The brent goose (<i>Anser torquatus</i>) is excellent
eating, and its flesh is free from fishy taste. Then
follow the little auk or rotge (<i>Alca alle</i>), the dovekey,
or black guillemot (<i>Uria grylle</i>), the loon, or thick-billed
guillemot (<i>Uria Brunnichii</i>). The first two
are better baked with a crust, and the last makes, with
spices and wine, a soup but little inferior to that of
English hare. All these are found together in flocks,
but the easiest method of obtaining them is either to
shoot them at the cliffs where they breed, or as they fly
to and fro from their feeding ground.</p>

<p>‘The ducks now come upon the table, and are placed
in the following order by most Polar epicures. The
long-tailed duck (<i>Fuliluga glacialis</i>), the king duck
(<i>Anas spectabilis</i>), and the eider duck (<i>A. mollissima</i>).
They require to be skinned before roasting or boiling,
and are then eatable, but are always more or less fishy.</p>

<p>‘The divers are by some thought superior for the
table to the ducks, but the difference is very slight.
The red-throated diver was most frequently seen, but
few were shot; and of the great northern divers
(<i>Colymbus glacialis</i>) none were brought to table, two
only having been seen. Some of the gulls were eaten,
and pronounced equal to the other sea birds; they
were the kittiwake, the tern, and the herring or
silver gull.</p>

<p>‘The denizens of the sea have fallen little under
our notice, and they may be dismissed with the remark,
that curried narwhal’s skin can be tolerated, but not
recommended. Some fresh-water fish were caught, and
proved to be very good; they are said to be a kind of
trout.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>The eggs of sea-fowl, although much eaten on the
coasts, are seldom brought to market for consumption in
our large English towns, and yet they form a considerable
article of traffic in several parts of the world,
and are procured in immense quantities about the lands
near the North and South Poles.</p>

<p>The precipitous cliffs of England are occasionally
searched for the eggs of the razor-billed auk, which
are esteemed a delicacy, for salads especially.</p>

<p>A correspondent at San Francisco informs me that
an important trade is carried on in that city in the eggs
of sea birds. He states, that the Farallones de los
Frayles, a group of rocky islets, lying a little more
than twenty miles west of the entrance to the Bay of
San Francisco, are the resort of innumerable sea-fowl,
known by the fishermen as ‘murres.’ These islands are
almost inaccessible, and, with a single exception, are
uninhabited. They, therefore, very naturally afford a
resort for great multitudes of birds. Some time since
a company was organized in San Francisco for the
purpose of bringing the eggs of the murres to market.
An imperfect idea of the numbers of these birds may
be formed from the fact, that this company sold in that
city the last season (a period of less than two months,
July and parts of June and August) <i>more than five
hundred thousand eggs</i>! All these were gathered on a
single one of these islands; and, in the opinion of the
eggers, not more than one egg in six of those deposited
on that island was gathered. My correspondent informs
me that he was told by those familiar with the
islands that all the eggs brought in were laid by birds
of a single kind. Yet they exhibit astonishing variations
in size, in form, and in colouring. There is no
reason to suppose that he was misinformed in regard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
these eggs being deposited by a single species. The
men could have had no motive for deception, and
similar facts are observable on the Labrador coast and
in the islands north of Scotland. Besides, the writer
ascertained from other sources, that all the eggs
brought to the market were obtained from a limited
portion of the island, known as the Great Farallone—called
the Rookery, where a single species swarm in
myriads, and where no other kind of bird is found.
Naturalists, who have received specimens of these
birds, pronounce them to be the thick-billed or Brunnich’s
guillemot, or murre, of Labrador and Northern Europe.
The eggs are three and a half inches in length, and are
esteemed a great delicacy.</p>

<p>There is a small island off the Cape of Good Hope,
named Dassen Island, about six miles from the mainland,
which is one and a half mile long by one broad,
from which 24,000 eggs of penguins and gulls are
collected every fortnight, and sold at Cape Town for a
half-penny each.</p>

<p>The late Lieut. Ruxton, R.N., speaking of the
Island of Ichaboe, on the Western Coast of Africa,
says, ‘Notwithstanding that the island had been occupied
for nearly two years, during which time thousands
upon thousands of penguins had been wantonly destroyed,
on the cessation of work these birds again
flocked to their old haunts, where they had again commenced
laying their eggs. The rocks round the island
are literally covered with penguins, cormorants, and
albatrosses. The former, wedged together in a dense
phalanx, have no more dread of man than ducks in a
poultry-yard, although they have met with such persecution
on the island; and any number might be taken
by the hand without any difficulty. The sailors eat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
livers and hearts, which are exceedingly palatable, but
the flesh of the body is rank and oily.’<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Captain Morrell, also writing of Ichaboe (<i>Nautical
Magazine</i>, vol. 13, p. 374), tells us, ‘Eggs may be obtained
here in great quantities. In the months of
October and November this island is literally covered
with jackass-penguins and gannets, which convene here
for the purpose of laying and incubation. The nests
of the gannets are formed like those of the albatross, but
are not so much elevated; while the jackass-penguins
lay their eggs in holes in the ground from twelve to
thirty inches in depth, which they guard with the
strictest vigilance. They frequently lay three or four
eggs, but the gannet seldom lays more than two.’</p>

<p>A correspondent, writing from Tristan d’Acunha, in
September, gives an account of his adventures in taking
penguins’ eggs. ‘This is now the time for penguins’
eggs. They get great numbers of them. There are
two rookeries, as they call them; one on the east, and
one on the west, of us. To the one on the west, they
go over land, beyond Elephant Bay. I went there last
year, when I saw the great sea elephant and the penguins
for the first time. But this year I have been
disappointed, the weather has been so unsettled. But
yesterday was a fine day, and they were going in the
boat to the other, to which they can go only by water;
so I went with them. It was a good day, and we
landed easily, though it is a very bad beach. Fancy
the scene—a long, very narrow strip of land, at the
foot of a great rock, covered with the thick tussac grass,
far higher than my head; the whole place swarming
with these penguins—pretty to look at, but the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
ungainly creatures in their movements that I ever saw?
They stand almost upright. The breast is glossy
white, the rest is gray. A couple of tufts of those
pretty yellow feathers, of which I sent home a few,
adorn each side of the head and give them a very lively
appearance. They have no wings, but instead, a couple
of flippers, as they call them, like arms, which they use
about as gracefully as Punch does his. And then the
way in which they hop along! Talk of the motion of
a frog! it is elegance itself compared with them.
Altogether, they are the most interesting, curious
things in Tristan. They are about as big, and twice as
noisy, as a duck. Fancy going into the midst of thick
grass higher than your head, with thousands of them
round you, all croaking out in a harsh, loud, quick
note, ‘Cover up! cover up!’ and then kicking them
right and left, quickly, taking care they do not get
hold of you,—seizing their great eggs, till you have
got some hundreds of them in your bosom. The men
wear a large shirt, tied round their waist, so as to form
a large loose bag in front, and so pop them in as fast
as they can pick them up. The men will gather two or
three hundred in this way, and the boys from one to
two; and from the other rookery carry them the whole
way home—no little load. The eggs vary much in
size, from a large hen’s egg to a goose’s. They mostly
lay two at once. Their nests are sometimes close
together, so you can soon pick up a lot. They stand
in pairs, each couple at their nest to defend it, and some
will not give up till they have been kicked away two or
three times. They can give a good sharp bite, if they
get hold of you. The men found me a spot where the
eggs were very thick, and very little tussac, and though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
I was a new hand at the work, and therefore obliged to
look sharp to escape a bite, I managed to collect more
than a hundred of them in a short time. Fancy what
work, to stand amid hundreds of the birds, all screaming
round you, so as almost to deafen you, tumbling them
here and there, and picking up their eggs as fast as
you can gather them! It is really amusing sport. I
must remind you the kicking them over with our soft
moccasins (shoes) does not hurt them in the least, and
the next day they will have just as many eggs.</p>

<p>‘Six of the men went round in the boat. We were
there about four hours, and gathered about four thousand—pretty
near a boat’s load; and could have got
more if we had chosen. It was a pleasant day, and we
had a good row back.’</p>

<p>An interesting account which recently appeared in a
Jamaica paper, respecting egg gathering, is also worth
quoting.</p>

<p>The annual egg gathering visit, which the boatmen
of Port Royal make to the Pedro Keys, we may set
down as a remnant of Indian life. In the work entitled
<i>The Discovery of America by Christopher
Columbus, compiled from his papers by his son Don
Ferdinand</i>, we are informed, that on the 13th of November,
1492, the discovery squadron weighing from the
Rio de Mares, Cuba, stood to the eastward, to search
for the island called Bohio by the Indians, and coming
to an anchor among some high raised islets on the
coast, found them to be places visited by the Indians
at certain seasons of the year, for supplies of fish and
birds. ‘The islands,’ Columbus says, ‘were not inhabited,
but there were seen the remains of many fires
which had been made by the fishermen; for it afterwards
appeared that the people were in use to go over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
in great numbers in their canoes to these islands, and
to a great number of other uninhabited islets in these
seas, to live upon fish, which they catch in great abundance,
and upon birds and crabs, and other things
which they find on the land. The Indians follow this
employment of fishing and bird-catching according to
the seasons, sometimes in one island sometimes in another,
as a person changes his diet, when weary of
living on one kind of food.’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>‘From the lighthouse on the Port Royal palisades to
Portland in Vere, a line encloses a system of coast
islands, reefs, banks, and shoals colonized by numerous
birds and fishes. Each kind has its own locality.
Pelican Key and Pigeon Island never interchange inhabitants,
and the bank that gives the king-fish furnishes
neither the snapper nor the grouper. Southward
from Portland, at a distance of some few leagues, the
great Pedro bank is reached, stretching near 100 miles.
There are islets at each extremity, but the group that
attracts the egg gatherers every year, are the Keys,
distinguished as the Pedros, at its eastern end. We
shall loiter a little to describe a living world there that
must have been a great attraction to the aboriginal
Indians, in those periodical junketings that came under
the notice of Columbus.</p>

<p>‘The Port Royal boats bound for the egg harvest,
bring to, at the outermost of the Portland Keys, and
start at midnight from there, to gain with a favourable
breeze in 14 or 15 hours the shelter of the Pedros, and
to be snug at anchor long before sundown. The vessels
in their voyage steer for a single rock in fathomless
water, the Isla Sola of the Spanish maps. It rises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
about 30 or 40 feet out of the sea like a castle in
ruins, over which the surf breaks fiercely; and in
about five or six hours after making it, they anchor
within what are properly called the Keys.</p>

<p>‘There are numerous outlying rocks just above and
beneath the water, between the Pedro shoal and the
open sea, on which the winds and the currents roll
a heavy surf. The spots properly called the islands
are seven in number, and vary from forty to some three
or four acres in size. They are upthrown masses of
broken coral and shell cemented by calcareous sand,
washed upon rocky ledges above the sea. The breakers
shift with the shifting winds, rolling these fragmentary
deposits on before them. By the regularity of their
change of action, they have done the work of accumulation
pretty equally on all sides: they have raised a
wall all round the islands, and left the centres hollow.</p>

<p>‘From time to time storms of unusual violence have
carried the heaped-up coral and sand suddenly, and in
thick layers, over portions of the islands where the
dung of the sea birds had accumulated for years, and
these irruptions have made intermediate deposits of
animal matter and cemented rock. It is evident from
the prevalence of this succession of deposits within the
hollow centres of the islets, that the sea has washed in
the fragmentary materials of the outer margins, by a
more than ordinary rise of the waters, and laid them in
pretty equal strata at distant intervals of time, so that
the centres have risen in height as the sea walls have
been built and cemented up. The animal deposits,
which may be characterized as loosely cohering urate
of lime, are sometimes found two feet beneath the strata
of cemented coral and shells, and run about an inch or
an inch and a half thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>‘Immediately within the islands, the waters shoal,
and make a bank called the Vibora by the Spaniards.
It runs to the Cascabel rock, 90 odd miles westward,
bristled with reefs and sunken rocks, having a depth of
from 7 to 17 fathoms. Easterly winds, that is, the
trade winds, veering southward and northward, for determinate
portions of the year, roll constant billows
over it. Westerly breezes, varying northerly and
southerly, bring tremendous gales and heavy swells.
The rough agency of all these movements has heaped
up the sands, and the corals, and shells, cementing
them into rock, and giving the island an elevation of
from 15 to 20 feet.</p>

<p>‘The vegetation on these islands is stunted surianas,
among whose tough and twisted branches the birds
find nestling places. To these lonely islets resort
thousands and tens of thousands of sea-fowl. As soon
as visitors land, myriads of birds are upon the wing
in all directions. Some flocks rise in circling flight
high up into the air, and descending again in the same
dense numbers as they rose, settle in more remote
places; others break away hurriedly, and fly in a wide
sweep far around, but return again hastily to the rocks
they had quitted, reconciled to bear with the disturbance.
The turmoil and hubbub of the thousands of
birds thus suddenly put upon the wing, overpower for
a moment the roar of the breakers, and darken the
air like the sudden passing of a cloud.</p>

<p>‘The constant inhabitants of the rocks are several
species of the booby, gannets, terns, gulls, and petrels—and
the frigate pelican. The frigate-birds preserve
their predilection for rapine amid the teeming plenty
of the waters, and subsist by pillaging the gulls and
gannets. The migratory visitors are ducks, herons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
plovers, snipes, sandpipers, curlews, and ibises, with
the several falcons that follow them. In the autumnal
movement of these birds towards the equatorial regions,
they would be found steering from north
to south, but at the time when the egg gatherers
visit the islets, they are seen coming from the south,
just resting and departing north. The successive
months of March, April, and May, are those of the
egg harvest.</p>

<p>‘The Keys are open to all adventurers, but the egg
gathering is regulated by a custom which recognises
the first coming vessel as commanding for the season.
The second vessel in seniority is called the Commodore,
the first being styled the Admiral. They have
a code of laws, to which, in a spirit of honourable
compliance, all are expected to show obedience; and in
case of any infraction of the obligations thus voluntarily
imposed upon themselves, a jury selected from
the several vessels tries complaints, and with due formality
inflicts punishment for offences.</p>

<p>‘The south-west is the principal of the Pedro Keys.
The stay of the birds that resort there to breed is prolonged
by the successive loss of the eggs they lay.
Each loss is a stimulus to a fresh act of pairing; a
new lot of eggs being the result, possibly in number
equal to the former lot, but probably less, as the latter
deposits are a forced production, at the expense of the
vigour of the bird, without any additional strength to
the constitution by the increased nourishment of food,
the process by which domesticated birds, in changing
their habits, are led to lay a continuance of eggs for a
long season. The egg gatherers are careful observers
of the progress of incubation, and take only the eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
they know to be fresh laid. These are a part of the
regulations they require to be observed, or the constant
depredations committed on the birds would fatally thin
their numbers.</p>

<p>‘Without going into the discussion of naturalists,
who see in the different colours of eggs a certain relation
to circumstances favourable to concealment, it may
be observed that the blotched egg, laid by the <i>Hydrochelidon
fuliginosa</i>, properly distinguished as the <i>egg-bird</i>,
is found among sticks and dried leaves of the suriana,
whilst the white eggs of the boobies and petrels
are deposited in hollows of the coral rocks, amid sand
and chalky dung. There is one curious coincidence
between the eggs of the noddy, <i>Sterna stolida</i>, and
the peculiarities of the nest, that must not, however,
be unremarked. The elaborate pile of sticks slightly
hollowed, in which they deposit their eggs, is always
embellished with broken sea shells, speckled and
spotted like the eggs. Audubon records the same
occurrence in the nests of the noddy terns he inspected
in the Florida Keys. The obvious suggestion for this
curious prevalence of instinct is deceptiveness, arising
from similarity between the egg shell and the sea shell.
The nests are pillaged by what is called the laughing
gull (the <i>Larus atricilla</i>, not the <i>ridibundus</i>); the
numerous empty shells lying among the rocks being
always set down to the predatory visits of the laughing
gull.</p>

<p>‘South-west Key, and the other sandy islets around
it, are beside, annually resorted to by the fishermen
in the turtling season for a different harvest of eggs.
The turtles (<i>Chelone midas</i>) visit these shoals to deposit
their eggs in the dry sand, and leave them to the fostering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
influence of the sun. They repeat their layings
thrice, at the interval of two or three weeks, laying a
hundred at a time. Some experience is necessary to
trace the place of deposit, for the eggs are always laid
in the night; but few of them escape the detection of
the turtler.’</p>

<p>Geese are reared in large numbers in Alsace, the
livers of which are used in making the famous Strasburg
pies. In Denmark, geese and ducks are salted
down for winter use.</p>

<p>In Greenland, the snow goose affords great subsistence
to the natives, and the feathers are an article of
commerce. Each family will kill thousands in a season;
these, after being plucked and gutted, are flung in
heaps into holes dug for that purpose, and are covered
only with earth. The mould presses, and forms over
them an arch; and whenever the family have occasion
to open one of these magazines, they find their provisions
perfectly sweet and good.</p>

<p>In Captain Sir John Ross’s <i>Arctic Voyage to Regent
Inlet</i>, it is recorded, that when they discovered that
the wild geese had begun to lay on the margin of the
lakes, their eggs formed a dainty and wholesome repast.
‘The eggs on being weighed were found on an
average to be 4½ ounces—of a dingy white, faintly
speckled. The discovery of a goose’s nest, where the
process of incubation had not begun, was regarded by
them in the light of a treasure. To the natives, however,
it appeared to be a matter of very trifling import
whether the egg were freshly laid, or whether it were
within a few days of being hatched. Half-a-dozen eggs
beaten up with the young ones, in all stages of their
growth, from the first development of the form to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
complete formation of the fœtus, proved to the natives
what a dish of callipash and callipee is to the gourmandizing
alderman; nor were they very particular as to
the embryos being wholly divested of the shells, for
the latter appeared to be nearly of the same use as
beans to the food of a horse, to force him to masticate
the oats more thoroughly.’</p>

<p>The cygnet, or young of the swan, was formerly
much esteemed; at Norwich they were fattened for the
corporation. The flesh of the old birds is hard and ill
tasted.</p>

<p>The pintail (<i>Anas acuta</i>) is a very choice bird—the
very ‘ring tail’ of the duck tribe. They are undoubtedly
a <i>recherché morceau</i>, for, being essentially
grain feeders, they have no fishy flavour.</p>

<p>Widgeon and teal are in great favour when in good
condition.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">REPTILIA.</h2>
</div>


<p>We find various reptiles, <i>Chelonian</i>, <i>Saurian</i>, and
<i>Ophidian</i>, still forming articles of food in many quarters
of the world, and some so repulsive in their appearance,
that it seems difficult to conceive how they could first
have been tasted.</p>

<p>In the class <span class="smcap">Reptilia</span>, we have in the first order <i>Chelonia</i>
or <i>tortoises</i>, comprising the following which are
used as food:—1, several of the terrestrial tortoises,
genus <i>Testudo</i>; 2, some of the marsh tortoises or
Emydes, the chelodina, matamata, &amp;c.; 3, the cryptopus
or river tortoise; and 4, the marine tortoises or turtles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>In the second order <span class="smcap">Sauria</span> or lizards, we find—1,
crocodiles and alligators contributing to the sustenance
of man; 2, several of the iguarians.</p>

<p>In the third order, <span class="smcap">Ophidia</span> or serpents, the rattlesnake,
boas and pythons, and several other snakes.</p>

<p>In the fourth order, <span class="smcap">Amphibia</span>, some of the edible
and tree frogs.</p>

<p>We know not, observes a recent writer, why the
flesh of the vegetable-feeding tortoises should not be
adopted, as well as that of the green turtle, among the
various articles which are in request for the table.
There is much in habit and association of ideas; and
though persons who would not refuse turtle might
turn from tortoise with disgust, they may rest assured
that in Sicily and Italy these land tortoises are sold
in the markets, principally for being made into soup,
which dish is more esteemed than the flesh prepared in
any other way.</p>

<p>The flesh of a tortoise, called the matamata by the
aborigines of Cayenne (<i>Chelys matamata</i>, Dumeril,
<i>C. fimbriata</i>, Spix), is said to be highly esteemed in
various parts of Guiana.</p>

<p>There is a great variety of land tortoises in Trinidad
and some of the other West Indian Islands, which
in general are as delicious as the best green turtle.</p>

<p>The eggs of the close tortoise (<i>Testudo clausa</i>) of
North America, are reckoned a delicacy, and are about
the size of pigeons’ eggs.</p>

<p>The gopher tortoise (<i>Testudo Carolina</i>, of Leconte)
occasionally makes considerable depredations in the
potato fields of the farmer, and in gardens and other
cultivated grounds, but its flesh is excellent, and hence
it is sought after for the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>The flesh of the Carolina terrapin or box tortoise
(<i>Cistudo Carolina</i>) is occasionally eaten, but it is held
in low estimation; the eggs, however, which are about
as large as those of a pigeon, are accounted excellent,
and are much sought after.</p>

<p>The flesh of the European box tortoise (<i>Cistudo
Europæa</i>), though not very delicate, is nevertheless
eaten on the Continent; it is said, however, to be
greatly improved by feeding the animals for some
time on grains, bran, and other vegetable aliment.
The salt water terrapin (<i>Emys concentrica</i>), which is
found both in North and South America, is in great
request, its flesh being highly esteemed as a delicacy for
the table, especially at the close of the summer, when the
animals have returned to their winter dormitory. They
are then fat, and considered as a luxury.</p>

<p>The eggs of the terrapin are not provided with a
hard shell, but a skin like that purest of all parchments,
parchment just before it receives the ink of law
upon it.</p>

<p>The general method of killing these animals is a
most barbarous one. They are laid upon their backs,
either close to the fire, or upon the red wood-ashes,
until the thick shell becomes so hot to the animal
within that he desperately stretches out both legs and
neck, in the vainest of endeavours to extricate himself
from the walls of his burning house. The tender-hearted
cook watches his opportunity, and when it is
evident that, in ordinary phrase, the poor terrapin
‘cannot contain itself,’ or in other words, will no longer
draw back his head into such a living furnace—the knife
descends, and the head is cut away. The late Mr.
Charles Hooton told me, that he had seen such heads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
at least half-an-hour after being cut off, attempt, on
being touched, to bite with sufficient force to take the
piece out of the finger. During this time the eyes
will occasionally open, though generally they remain
shut.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Indian Cryptopus, a river or fluviatile
tortoise (<i>Cryptopus granosus</i>, Bibr., <i>Testudo scabra</i>,
Latr.) is eaten in Pondicherry and Coromandel, where it
lives in large sheets of fresh water or lagoons.</p>

<p>The flesh of the soft tortoise of America (<i>Trionyx
ferox</i>, Cuvier), which inhabit the rivers of Carolina and
Georgia, is eaten.</p>

<p>The curious New Holland tortoise (<i>Chelodina longicollis</i>),
first described by Shaw, which, as far as
the head and neck is concerned, reminds one rather
of a snake than a tortoise, is abundant in some of
the lakes of Western Australia, and is considered by
the natives a great treat, as are also the snakes and
lizards.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Temple, of Honduras, from whose
lively and interesting letters to the Society of Arts I
have already quoted, says—‘Another article which
might be preserved and exported, and which would, I
have little doubt, be highly prized by epicures in England,
is the liver of the hiccatee. The hiccatee is the
fresh water turtle or tortoise, and is, I believe, altogether
unknown in Europe. It never approaches anything
like the size of the large turtles. The weight of the
hiccatee seldom exceeds 20 lbs. It has not got fins like
a turtle, or to be more correct, the sea tortoise, but
round, webbed-feet, each having five claws, like those of
a duck. It is made for the land, therefore, as well as
the water. It does not, however, make the former its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
home, and its feet are evidently intended merely to
enable it, when one pool becomes dry, to travel in
search of another. The hiccatee is generally caught in
the dry season, when going across the country in pursuit
of water. The feet when dressed are gelatinous,
but the flesh is dry and fibrous. It is, however, the
liver which renders this species of tortoise so highly
estimable. It is a dark olive colour, and immensely
large. If this were preserved in oil with truffles, it
would be considered far superior to the goose’s liver of
which the <i>pâté de foie gras</i> is made.’</p>

<p>The following way of effectually shooting a turtle
may be interesting to the sporting world generally,
and aldermen in particular. ‘The soft-shell turtle is
found throughout the south, and abounds in the rivers
and bayous of Louisiana, where they are esteemed a
delicacy. They are so shy as to elude the various inventions
which are adopted to capture them; the rifle
has, therefore, been resorted to; and, though easily
killed by a fair marksman, when he finds them sunning
themselves on the floating or projecting trunk of some
old tree, he still often fails to secure his prize, since they
drop into the bayous, are swept down into the current,
and scarcely, if ever, secured. To remedy this, a gentleman
of Louisiana adopted the following method successfully.
He cut a piece of wood, one inch long, and
rounded it so as to fit easily in his rifle; around the
middle, crosswise, he cut a small groove, so as to secure
to it a twine some six or seven inches long; at the other
end of this string he attached the ball, by passing the
string through a bore in the ball, and then knotting the
end of the string. The ball is first inserted in the
rifle; the string and wood follow, and all are rammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
down. The turtle is now shot, and as the ball passes
through the turtle, it enters the tree or log some one or
two inches; the piece of wood, being too light to enter
the shell of the turtle, is left suspended. So that, at a
single shot, the game is killed, strung, and hung up.’
Of course, this is from an American paper.</p>

<p>The flesh of the land tortoise is largely used for food,
both fresh and when salted, in the Gallipagos Archipelago
and other islands of the Pacific; and a beautifully
clear oil is prepared from their fat. They are eaten in
Australia by the aborigines; and in Russia, on the shores
of the Mediterranean, and some parts of Germany, are
fattened for the table, and are esteemed a great delicacy.
Wallace, in his journeys up the Amazon, says he found
the land tortoise for dinner as good as turtle.</p>

<p>Captain Dampier, when he visited the Gallipagos, in
1684, records ‘That there is no place in the world so much
stored with guanoes and land tortoises as these isles.
The first are fat and of an extraordinary size, and exceeding
tame; and the land tortoises so numerous, that
some hundred men may subsist on them for a considerable
time, being very fat, and as pleasant food as a
pullet, and of such bigness that one of them weighs 150
or 200 lbs.; and are from two feet to two feet six
inches over the belly; whereas, in any other places, I
never met with any above 30 lbs. weight, though I have
heard them say that at St. Lawrence or Madagascar
there are also very large ones.’</p>

<p>Wafer, another old voyager, when at these islands,
salted the flesh of the land tortoise for use on shipboard,
and fried the fat and converted it into lard or oil,
of which they secured 60 large jars.</p>

<p>Tortoises of an immense size are found on many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of the islands of the Pacific. Mr. Lawson, a vice-governor
of the Gallipagos Archipelago, states that he
has seen several so large that it required six or eight
men to lift them from the ground; and that some had
afforded as much as 200 lbs. of meat. Dr. Darwin
remarks: ‘I was always amused when overtaking
one of these great monsters, as it was quietly pacing
along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it
would draw in its head and legs, and, uttering a deep
hiss, fall to the ground with a heavy sound, as if struck
dead. I frequently got on their backs, and then giving
a few raps on the hinder part of their shells, they would
rise up and walk away; but I found it very difficult
to keep my balance. The flesh of this animal is
largely employed, both fresh and salted; and a beautifully
clear oil is prepared from the fat. When a tortoise
is caught, the man makes a slit in the skin near its
tail, so as to see inside its body, whether the fat under
the dorsal plate is thick. If it is not, the animal is
liberated; and it is said to recover soon from this
strange operation.</p>

<p>In chasing the turtle, a man standing ready in the
bow of the boat dashes through the water upon the
turtle’s back; then clinging with both hands by the
shell of its neck, he is carried away till the animal becomes
exhausted and is secured. In the Chagos
Archipelago, the natives, by a horrible process, take the
shell from the back of the living turtle. It is covered
with burning charcoal, which causes the outer shell to
curl upwards; it is then forced off with a knife, and before
it becomes cold flattened between two boards.
After this barbarous process, the animal is suffered to
regain its native element, where, after a certain time, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
new shell is formed; it is, however, too thin to be of
any service, and the animal always appears languishing
and sickly.</p>

<p>Dampier, in 1684, speaks of three or four kinds of
land tortoises being eaten in the West Indies. ‘One,’
he says, ‘is called by the Spaniards <i>Hackatee</i>, which
keep most in fresh-water ponds; they have small legs
and long necks, and flat feet, and commonly weigh betwixt
ten and fifteen pounds. The second sort they call
<i>Tenopen</i> (terrapin?), much less than the former, and
something rounder; but for the rest not unlike them,
except that the shell on their backs is naturally
coloured with a curious carved work. Both sorts afford
very good meat, and these last delight in low marshy
places, and are in vast numbers at the Isle of Pines,
near Cuba, among the woods.’</p>

<p>Turtle would seem to have been first introduced in
England, as an article of food, about the middle of the 17th
century, for a record in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, under
date August 31, 1753, shows that it was then a rarity.
‘A turtle, weighing 350 lbs., was ate at the King’s Arms
tavern, Pall Mall; the mouth of an oven was taken down
to admit the part to be baked.’ The locality for eating
them now has been transferred principally to the city;
and the Ship and Turtle, the London Tavern, Birch’s
(in Cornhill), and the Guildhall or Mansion-house, are
perhaps the largest depôts of consumption. Steam
communication has greatly increased the imports, which
amount to about 15,000 in the year, weighing from one
quarter to three hundred weight, and valued at, probably,
£8,000. Not that all these shielded animals can be
called ‘lively’ turtle, for the voyage has very often a
damaging effect upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Turtling is much resorted to by the inhabitants of
Grand Cayman, 160 miles north-west from Jamaica. The
turtle are now chiefly caught on the Mosquito coast, or on
the South Keys of Cuba, and sold either in Jamaica or
to homeward-bound vessels. Formerly, these valuable
animals were abundant at Grand Cayman itself, but the
very reprehensible practice which has prevailed there,
for some years past of making use of large quantities
of their eggs deposited on the shore, has almost
frightened them entirely away.</p>

<p>In an account of Jamaica, published in 1683, we find
the following statement respecting turtle hunting and
other articles of food:—</p>

<p>‘Tortoise are taken much on this coast, but chiefly
at the island of Caymanos, thirty leagues to the west of
this island, whither the vessels go May, June, and
July, to load of their flesh, that they pickle in bulk, and
take them in that season when they come on shore to
lay their eggs, which they do, and cover them with
sand, that hatches them; and then by instinct they
crawl to the sea, where they live, and feed on weed
that grows in the bottom or floats. In many rivers and
ponds of Jamaica, there is vast numbers of crocodiles or
allegators, that is an amphibious creature, and breeds an
egg, hatch’d by the sun in the sand. A tortoise egg
is just like the yolk of a hen egg, of which she lays near
a peck at a time; but the allegator but a few, and are
like a turkey’s. Their flesh is not good; they are voracious,
and live on fowls and beasts that they catch by
surprise, but seldom or never hurt any man.</p>

<p>‘Here’s an Indian coney, called racoon, that is good
meat; but of a distasteful shape, being something like
an overgrown rat. The snakes in this island are not at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
all hurtful, but were eaten by the Indians as regular as
the guanaes are by the Spaniards; it is but small, and of
the shape of an allegator, and the flesh is sweet and tender.’</p>

<p>I was told a story not long ago of a distinguished
American politician from the rural districts, who came
to New York, and resolved to give a splendid dinner to
some of his party friends. In order to make sure that
everything should be of the very best quality, he went
to the market himself, and bought first a <i>turtle</i>. After
taking great pains to select one of the finest specimens
in the lot, and ordering it to be sent home, he said to
the tradesman, by way of making it quite right, ‘This
is a right down genuine turtle, aint it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, certainly,’ was the reply, ‘one of the very best.’</p>

<p>‘Because,’ he added, ‘although I ain’t been in the
city long, I ain’t to be humbugged: it won’t do for you
to try to put off any of your confounded <i>mock</i> turtles
on me!’</p>

<p>The turtle dealer stood astounded at his customer’s
sharpness.</p>

<p>Sir James E. Alexander calls Ascension ‘the headquarters
of the finest turtle in the world,’ and his account
of the operations connected with turtling in that locality
is so interesting that I must copy it.</p>

<p>‘We walked down to the turtle ponds, two large enclosures
near the sea, which flowed in and out through
a breakwater of large stones. A gallows was erected
between the two ponds, where the turtle are slaughtered
for shipping, by suspending them by the hind flippers
and then cutting their throats. About 300 turtle of
four and five hundred pounds each lay on the sand or
swam about in the ponds—a sight to set an alderman
mad with delight!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>‘In the hot weather of January, February, March, and
April, the females land at night, and waddling over the
sands in the various bays of the island, far above high-water
mark,—for by a pole in the ponds, the tide only
rises here four feet,—they scrape up, by alternate scoops
of their flippers, a hole deep enough to cover their
bodies. Into this they get, sighing heavily, and deposit
from 150 to 200 eggs, cover them up, leaving
them to the sun to hatch; and then waddle again towards
the sea. Two stout hands are, meanwhile, on the
look out, watching the movements of the unfortunate
turtle; and, running up to her after the completion of her
task, one seizes a fore flipper and dexterously shoves it
under her belly to serve as a purchase; whilst the other,
avoiding a stroke which might lame him, cants the
turtle over on her back, where she lies helpless. From
fifteen to thirty are thus turned in a night; and 600
had been so captured in the season of 1834.</p>

<p>‘In the bays, when the surf of heavy rollers prevents
the boats being beached to take on board the turtle when
caught, they are hauled out to them by ropes.</p>

<p>‘No ships’ crews are now allowed to turn turtle, which
is converted into a government monopoly; and £2 10<i>s.</i>
is the fixed price for each. Strange to say, from
the time that the young turtle, the size of a dollar,
are observed scuttling down to the water, they are
never seen again here until they are four or five hundred
pounds weight; and how long they take to attain
this great size, and where they spend the intermediate
time, is as yet a mystery. I was surprised to
hear that turtle are kept in the ponds for a year and
upwards without a morsel of food of any kind. They
sometimes deposit their eggs in the sand, on the sides of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the ponds; and in due time the little animals are allowed
to make their escape to the sea.</p>

<p>‘One old female called ‘Nelson,’ because one of her
flippers had been carried off by a shark, was kept, out
of respect, for two or three years in the ponds. She
contrived, however, one night to crawl round the enclosure
and make her escape; but she was turned next
year in Clarence Bay. Another turtle was also turned
there a short time since, on the back of which was carved
the name of a mate of a British vessel, who had bought it
and sailed with it three weeks before; it is probable that,
imagining it to be dead, he had thrown it overboard.</p>

<p>‘The best way to send home turtle from Ascension is,
to head them up in a <i>sealed</i> cask, and have the water
changed daily by the bung hole and a cork. Turtle,
though the extremes of heat and cold are equally injurious
to them, should always arrive in hot weather in
England. Thus, an unfortunate captain, on one occasion,
took from Ascension 200 turtle, and timing his arrival
badly, brought only four alive to Bristol!’</p>

<p>Humboldt, in his <i>Personal Narrative</i>, speaks of the
expertness of the jaguars of South America, who turn
the turtle on the beach and devour them at their ease,
emptying the double armour of the arraus, by the introduction
of their supple paws, with greater ingenuity than the
most skilful naturalist could do. They also eat the eggs.</p>

<p>The eggs are of a globular shape, with a soft semi-transparent
calcareous shell. These are much prized
whenever they can be procured as articles of food, both
by natives and Europeans. A native will consume
in Brazil as many as twenty or thirty eggs at one
meal, and an European sometimes eats a dozen for
breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Scarcely a thirtieth of the number of young turtles,
even if the eggs are all hatched, reach the sea, or live
after they have gained that element. Birds, and beasts,
and alligators, and rapacious fishes, all prey upon them.</p>

<p>The flesh of the female is held in the greatest estimation,
and it is considered to be in perfection at the
time she is about depositing her eggs. The flesh, the
eggs, and certain portions of the intestines, are often
salted and barrelled for shipment to a distance. The
eggs of the turtle, although oily, are very savory, and
make an excellent omelet. The shell does not harden,
but is leathery; and the white never coagulates, but is
thrown away and the yolk only eaten. The Indians
of Brazil frequently eat the eggs raw, mixed with their
cassava farinha.</p>

<p>Captain William Dampier, in his voyages, tells us, the
flesh of the hawk’s-bill turtle is eaten. ‘The flesh’ (he
remarks) ‘is but indifferent, yet somewhat better than
that of the loggerhead. Those taken betwixt the Sambellas
and Portobello, make those that eat their flesh
vomit and purge vehemently. The flesh however differs
according to their food, for those that feed upon
moss among the rocks have a much yellower fat and
flesh, and are not so well tasted as those that feed upon
grass.’</p>

<p>Soon after the fall of the waters of the Orinoco, which
begins in February, millions of turtle deposit their eggs
among the sand, and the Indians obtain a rich harvest
of food. From the eggs they procure a rich oil termed
‘<i>mantega</i>,’ which is preserved in pots. A good deal
is sent down the Amazon, fully to the value of £2,000,
and several thousand persons are occupied in its preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>The eggs are not very large, but about the size of a
bantam’s egg. The stratum of eggs in the sand is ascertained
by a pole thrust in, the mean depth being
about three feet, and the harvest of eggs is estimated
like the produce of a well cultivated acre; an acre,
accurately measured, of 120 feet long, and 30 wide,
having been known to yield 100 jars of oil. The eggs,
when collected, are thrown into long troughs of water,
and being broken and stirred with shovels, they remain
exposed to the sun till the yolk, the oily part, is collected
on the surface, and has time to inspissate; as fast as
this oily part is collected on the surface of the water,
it is taken off and boiled over a quick fire. This animal
oil, or tortoise grease, when prepared, is limpid,
inodorous, and scarcely yellow. It is used, not merely
to burn in lamps, but in dressing victuals, to which it
imparts no disagreeable taste. It is not easy, however,
to produce oil of turtle’s eggs quite pure. It has generally
a putrid smell, owing to the mixture of addled
eggs. The total gathering of the three shores, between
the junction of the Orinoco with the Apure, where the
collection of eggs is annually made, is 5,000 jars, and
it takes about 5,000 eggs to furnish one jar of oil.</p>

<p>In the Comarca of the Rio Nigro, the value of the
turtle oil imported in 1840 was 6,000 dollars; and from
the small town of Barra, on the Amazon, in 1850, turtle
oil of the value of 1818 dollars was sent. It is filled in
pots, of which 1628 were made in Santarrem, a mile
above the mouth of the Tapajos.</p>

<p>Turtle oil is employed for various purposes. In some
of the West India islands, it is used when fresh in the
place of butter, or salad oil, and also for lamps.</p>

<p>The eggs of most of the species are excellent, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
both nutritive and agreeable to the taste; those of the
green turtle are especially fine. The white, or albuminous
portion, does not, however, harden on boiling.</p>

<p>The large tree lizard, popularly termed the guana,
(<i>Iguana tuberculata</i>, Laur. Syn. 49) is certainly not
very attractive in appearance, and yet by most persons
its flesh is highly esteemed, being reckoned as delicate
as chicken, and but little inferior to turtle in flavour.</p>

<p>It is about three feet long, from the head to the extremity
of the tail, and covered with a soft skin of a
bluish green colour on the back and legs; on the sides
and belly, nearly white. It has a pouch of loose skin
under its throat, of a light green; eyes black; and
claws, of which there are three or five on each foot,
sharply pointed. A fringed skin, or kind of mane,
runs along from the head to the tail, which it erects
when irritated, and will then snap hold of anything
with great tenacity; but it is perfectly harmless if undisturbed.
The bite is painful, but is not dangerous.</p>

<p>This ugly-looking tree lizard, which looks like an
alligator in miniature, is considered a great delicacy
in most tropical countries. However white and tender
the flesh may be when cooked, when one of its fore
paws happens to stick up in the dish, it reminds one
too much of the allegator to eat it with any great
relish.</p>

<p>I know no animal, or rather reptile, whose appearance
is so little calculated to tempt man to eat of its flesh;
and yet, despite the repugnance that results from its looks,
neither Ude nor Soyer could have compounded any
dish that would compare to the delicacy of a well-dressed
iguana.</p>

<p>We all know that the turtle is most delicious, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
did we see it for the first time, we might call it with
the rustic ‘a great sea toad.’ The appearance of the
turtle does not carry a letter of recommendation to the
kitchen; accordingly, his introduction to the Lord
Mayor’s table was rather tardy, and we learn from Sir
Hans Sloane that, at the beginning of the last century,
turtle was only eaten in Jamaica by the poor.</p>

<p>The poet Gay hath sung, that he must have been a
bold man who first swallowed an oyster:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">‘The man had sure a palate covered o’er</div>
<div class="verse indent0">With steel or brass, that on the rocky shore</div>
<div class="verse indent0">First ope’d the oozy oyster’s pearly coat,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And risked the living morsel down his throat.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet neither turtle nor oyster looks so repugnant, yet
tastes so delicious, as an iguana.</p>

<p>Although often roasted or fricasseed, a frequent native
mode of cooking the iguana is to boil it, taking out the
leaves of fat, which are melted and clarified, and put
into a calabash or dish, into which they dip the flesh of
the guana as they eat it.</p>

<p>It was long before the Spaniards could conquer their
repugnance to the guana, the favourite delicacy of the
Indians, but which the former regarded with disgust
as a species of serpent. They found it however to be
highly palatable and delicate, and from that time forward,
the guana was held in repute among Spanish
epicures. The story is thus related by Peter Martyn:—</p>

<p>‘These serpentes are like unto crocodiles, saving in
bygness; they call them guanas. Unto that day none
of oure men durste adventure to taste of them, by
reason of they’re horrible deformitie and lothsomnes.
Yet the Adelantado being entysed by the pleasantnes
of the king’s sister Anacaona, determined to taste the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
serpentes. But when he felte the flesh thereof to be so
delycate to his tongue, he fell to amayne without al
feare. The which thynge his companions perceiving,
were not behynde hym in greedynesse: insomuche that
they had now none other talke than of the sweetnesse
of these serpentes, which they affirm to be of more
pleasant taste than eyther our phesantes or partriches.’</p>

<p>Pierre Labat gives a minute account of the mode of
catching this reptile, and if the reader has no objection
to accompany the good father <i>à la chasse</i>, he may
participate in the diversion as follows:—‘We were
attended,’ says he, ‘by a negro who carried a long
rod; at one end of which was a piece of whipcord
with a running knot. After beating the bushes for
some time, the negro discovered our game basking in
the sun on the dry limb of a tree. Hereupon he began
whistling with all his might, to which the guana was
wonderfully attentive, stretching out his neck, and
turning his head as if to enjoy it more fully. The
negro now approached, still whistling, and advancing
his rod gently, began tickling with the end of it the
sides and throat of the guana, who seemed mightily
pleased with the operation, for he turned on his back
and stretched himself out like a cat before the fire, and
at length fell fairly asleep; which the negro perceiving,
dexterously slipt the noose over his head, and with a
jerk brought him to the ground; and good sport it
afforded to see the creature swell like a turkey-cock
at finding himself entrapped. We caught others in the
same way, and kept one of them alive seven or eight
days; but,’ continues the reverend historian, ‘it grieved
me to the heart to find that he thereby lost much
delicious fat.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>Guanas are very large and plentiful on the outlying
cays and islands of the Bahamas. They are hunted
with a small kind of hound, and if taken alive, the
mouth is sewed up with twine, and they keep alive
a month or six weeks without food. Nassau, New Providence,
the capital is chiefly supplied from these islands
with the guana.</p>

<p>There are several varieties of this reptile in Australia,
but that which is most common is from four to six feet
in length, and from about a foot and a half to two feet
across the broadest part of the back, with a rough dark
skin, enlivened by yellow spots. Although perfectly
harmless, as far as the human race are concerned, this
huge lizard is a terrible foe to the smaller quadrupeds—opossums,
bandicoots, kangaroo-rats, &amp;c.,—on which
it preys. It is very destructive also among hen roosts,
and often takes up its quarters in the vicinity of a farm-house
for the convenience of supping on the hens and
their eggs.</p>

<p>The guana is much sought for and esteemed by the
blacks as an article of food, and is frequently presented
as a great delicacy to the young ‘gins.’ By the settlers
it is not often eaten, owing to the natural feeling of dislike
which is created by its form and habits. Those,
however, who do not entertain these feelings, or are
able to overcome them, find the flesh of the creature
really excellent. It is not unlike that of a rabbit,
to which, in flavour, it is fully equal, and eats best
when stewed or curried.</p>

<p>The guana usually lives in trees, and, on the approach
of man, it invariably makes off with great alacrity,
scrambling rapidly up the nearest trunk; but it is easily
brought down by a shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Captain Keppel tells us, ‘that while out on a shooting
excursion at Port Essington, he observed a native
plucking the feathers off a goose; while so employed
his eye caught the tip-end of the tail of an iguana, an
animal of the lizard kind, about four feet long, which
was creeping up the opposite side of a tree; he tossed
the goose, without further preparation, on to the fire,
and ascended the tree as easily as Jack would run up
the well-rattled rigging of a man-of-war. He almost
immediately returned with the poor animal struggling
in his scientific grasp. It was the work of a minute to
secure it to a stick of about the same length as itself to
prevent its running away, when it was made to change
places with the goose, which, being warm through, was
considered to be sufficiently done. The whole goose he
devoured, making no bones, but spitting out the feathers.
Then came the iguana’s turn, which, although less tender,
was not the less relished. It appeared to require
great muscular strength to detach the flesh from the
skin. The operation being finished, he lay down to
sleep. His wife, having sprinkled him with dirt to
keep the flies off, was proceeding to eat the skin of the
iguana, when the arrival of some more geese offered her
a more satisfactory repast.’</p>

<p>The iguana is, I believe, the Talagowa of the natives
of Ceylon—<i>le Monitor terrestre d’Egypte</i> of M. Cuvier.
The Indian monitor (<i>Monitor dracæna</i>, Gray) is
found in great abundance in all the maritime provinces
of Ceylon. The natives are partial to its flesh. Dr.
Kelaart states that he once tasted some excellent soup
made from a tender guana, which was not unlike
hare soup. At Trincomalee they are hunted down by
dogs, and sold in the market for 6<i>d.</i> each. They feed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
on the smaller reptiles and insects, and measure, when
large, four feet five inches. Despite its repulsive appearance,
the iguana is eagerly hunted for food by the
natives of Africa, Australia, America, and Asia.</p>

<p>The eggs of the guana are another article deserving
the attention of gourmands. One of these lizards
sometimes contains as many as four-score eggs. These
are about the size of a pigeon’s egg, with a very soft
shell, which contains only a very small quantity of
the albumen. The yolk, unlike that of other eggs,
does not become hard and dry when boiled, but is soft
and melting as marrow.</p>

<p>It would be a refreshing sight to see Alderman A.,
or Sheriff B., or any other civic dignitary who has
gone the round of all the dishes which native and
foreign skill have been able to produce, and to whom
a new combination would convey as much delight as a
black tulip or a blue dahlia would to a horticulturist,
partaking for the first time of <i>pâté de foie gras de
l’hiccatee</i>, or a dish of the eggs of the iguana garnished
with anchovies. The inhabitants of some of the Pacific
islands esteem the large oval eggs of the lizards as
food.</p>

<p>The meat of the <i>Amblyrynchus subcristatus</i>, another
lizard, when cooked, is white, and by those whose stomachs
rise above all prejudices it is relished as very
good. Humboldt has remarked, that in intertropical
South America, all lizards which inhabit dry regions
are esteemed delicacies for the table.</p>

<p>There are an almost innumerable variety of lizards,
properly so called, in all parts of the colony of New
South Wales, and the whole of the larger kinds are
used for food by the blacks, although but very rarely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
eaten by the settlers. Those who have eaten them,
state that their flesh resembles that of a fowl. The
dragon lizard, or as it is sometimes called, the frilled
lizard, is the most remarkable, being provided with
a large frill, which it has the power of extending
suddenly, and in a rather startling manner, when
attacked or alarmed; it is usually about a foot and a
half or two feet long. The Jew lizards are dark
coloured, with a dewlapped and puffy appearance about
the throat and neck, varying in size, but seldom exceeding
two feet in length. The scaly lizards are
fierce looking, although harmless, reptiles, with a spotted
scaly hide, generally about a foot long, and remarkable
for having small round club-shaped tails. They are
easily domesticated, but as their appearance is far from
attractive, they are seldom made pets of. The large
spiny-backed rock lizard resembles a guana, the
only material points of difference being that it has a
heavy dewlap beneath its chin, and a row of spines
along the back from the head to the tail. The flat-tailed
lizard, called by the natives the Rock Scorpion, is
imagined by them to be venomous, although in reality
it is perfectly harmless; it is nocturnal in its habits,
and possesses to a peculiar extent the singular power,
which is more or less vested in all the lizard family, of
leaving its tail in the hands of any one who attempts to
capture it by laying hold of that appendage, and
of making off apparently scatheless. The sleeping
lizard is in body, as well as in its sluggish habits,
exactly like the terrible death adder, from which it is
only to be distinguished by its short feet.</p>

<p>Many of the lizard family are believed by the settlers
to be venomous, but such is not the case; I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
in fact that no four-footed reptile has yet been discovered
which is possessed of venom.</p>

<p>A remarkable power possessed by the guana, and
perhaps by others of the lizard family, is its power of
resisting the poison, ordinarily most destructive to
animal life,—prussic acid. A middling sized guana
took a small bottle of prussic acid, and seemed rather
to have been exhilarated by it than otherwise; it was
killed, however, by a dose of arsenic and spirits of
wine.</p>

<p>There is a large, ugly, amphibious lizard, about
three feet long, met with in Guiana, known as the
Salempenta, or <i>El Matêo</i>, which is thought (particularly
by the Indians) good eating, the flesh being
white and tender. It is, however, much more ugly
in appearance than the guana.</p>

<p>Occasionally large lizards of other kinds, two or three
feet in length, are brought to the Rio market, and they
are said to be excellent eating.</p>

<p>In the reign of Cheops, as an Egyptian gentleman
curious in poultry, and famous even there for his success
in producing strange birds, was walking by the river
Nile, he met with an egg, which, from its appearance,
he thought promised results out of the common way;
so, picking it up, he took it home, and gave directions
for hatching it. But some time after, on visiting his
poultry yard, he found that all his pets had disappeared,
a few feathers only lying scattered about, whilst a fearful
animal rushed upon him open-mouthed. The fact
was, <i>he had hatched a crocodile</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph, in his <i>History of Trinidad</i>, tells us,
that he has eaten the eggs of the cayman or alligator,
(without knowing what eggs they were), and found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
them good. In form and taste they much resemble
the eggs of the domestic hen.</p>

<p>Dr. Buckland, the distinguished geologist, one day
gave a dinner, after dissecting a Mississippi alligator, having
asked a good many of the most distinguished of his
classes to dine with him. His house and his establishment
were in good style and taste. His guests congregated.
The dinner-table looked splendid, with
glass, china, and plate, and the meal commenced with
excellent soup. ‘How do you like the soup?’ asked
the doctor, after having finished his own plate, addressing
a famous gourmand of the day. ‘Very good, indeed,’
answered the other; ‘turtle, is it not? I only ask
because I do not find any green fat.’ The doctor shook
his head. ‘I think it has something of a musky taste,’
said another; ‘not unpleasant, but peculiar.’ ‘All alligators
have,’ replied Buckland; ‘the cayman particularly
so. The fellow whom I dissected this morning——’
At this stage there was a general rout of the whole
guests. Every one turned pale. Half-a-dozen started
up from the table; two or three ran out of the room;
and only those who had stout stomachs remained to the
close of an excellent entertainment. ‘See what imagination
is!’ said Buckland. ‘If I had told them it
was turtle, or tarrapen, or birdsnest soup, salt-water
amphibia or fresh, or the gluten of a fish, or the maw
of a sea bird, they would have pronounced it excellent,
and their digestion been none the worse. Such is prejudice.’
‘But was it really an alligator?’ asked a lady.
‘As good a calf’s head as ever wore a coronet,’ answered
Buckland.</p>

<p>The Australian crocodile is more closely allied to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
gavial of India (<i>Gavialis gangeticus</i>), but is now often
termed, like the American species, an alligator. It is
large and formidable; one captured by Captain Stokes,
in the Victoria River, and described in his published
journal, was fifteen feet long, and some have been taken
still larger than this. Like all animals of its class, the
Australian crocodile is a much more formidable enemy
in the water than on shore; but even in the latter position,
it is by no means to be despised, for it progresses
with tolerable speed; and, although it seldom or never
attacks a man openly when out of its own proper element,
still it is believed to have a strong liking for
human flesh, when that delicacy can safely be obtained.
One of these creatures paid a visit to a seaman, who
was asleep in his hammock on shore after a hard day’s
labour, and being unable to get conveniently at the
man, it managed to drag off and carry away the
blanket which covered him; the sailor at first charged
his comrade with having made him the subject of a
practical joke, but the foot-prints of the huge reptile,
and the discovery of the abstracted blanket in the
water, soon showed him the real character of his nocturnal
visitant.</p>

<p>The flesh of the crocodile is white and delicate, resembling
veal. It was a favourite dish among the Port
Essington settlers, and among the seamen employed in
the surveys of the northern coast and rivers of Australia.
It is frequently pursued and killed for food by the aborigines
of that part of the country: the plan which
they adopt is to hunt it into some blind creek, when
the reptile, finding itself closely pressed, and no water
near, usually forces its head, and perhaps the upper part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
of its body in some sand-hole, fancying that it has, by
so doing, concealed itself from its pursuers. In this
position it is despatched with comparative ease. The
crocodile makes a terrible noise by snapping its jaws,
particularly when in pain, or when it is annoyed by the
buzzing about its mouth and eyes of the mosquitoes or
other insects, which are found in myriads among the
swamps, creeks, and shallow waters, where it abides;
this snapping noise is often a startling sound to explorers
encamping near waters frequented by the
monster.</p>

<p>The aboriginal tribes far to the southward of the
localities in which the crocodile has its habitation, have
an imperfect knowledge of the animal; stories of its
voracity and fierceness have probably been recounted at
the friendly meetings of the tribes, and these stories
have in the same manner passed across the continent,
changed and magnified with each new relation, until on
reaching the coast tribes of the south, the crocodile
became a nondescript animal of most terrible form,
frightening the blacks and puzzling the whites under
the name of the Bunyip.</p>

<p>In Dongola, at the present day, the crocodile is
caught for the sake of its flesh, which is regarded as a
delicacy. The flesh and fat are eaten by the Berbers,
who consider them excellent. Both parts, however,
have a smell of musk so strong that few strangers can
eat crocodiles’ flesh without violent sickness following.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Haensel, in his <i>Letters on the Nicobar
Islands</i>, tells us that ‘part of the flesh of the crocodile,
or cayman, is good and wholesome when well cooked.
It tastes somewhat like pork, for which I took it, and
ate it with much relish, when I first came to Nancauwery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
till, on inquiry, finding it to be the flesh of a
beast so disgusting and horrible in its appearance and
habits, I felt a loathing, which I could never overcome;
but it is eaten by both natives and Europeans.’ The
aboriginal natives of Trinidad considered a broiled
slice of alligator as a dainty morsel; and Mr. Joseph,
the historian, records having tasted it, and found it
very palatable. Tastes in this, as in other matters,
differ.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Koster, in his <i>Travels in Brazil</i>, says—‘I
have been much blamed by my friends for not
having eaten of the flesh of the alligator, and, indeed,
I felt a little ashamed of my squeamishness when I was
shown by one friend a passage in a French writer,
whose name I forget, in which he speaks favourably of
this flesh. However, if the advocate for experimental
eating had seen an alligator cut into slices, he would, I
think, have turned from the sight as quickly as I did.’
The Indians of South America eat these creatures, but
none of the negroes will touch them.</p>

<p>Dr. Madden, in his <i>Travels in Egypt</i>, appears to
have experimentalized on the saurians as food—</p>

<p>‘I got’ (he says) ‘a small portion of a young crocodile,
six feet long, broiled, to ascertain its taste. The flavour
a good deal resembles that of a lobster, and, though
somewhat tough, it might certainly be considered very
excellent food.’</p>

<p>The spectacled cayman (<i>Alligator sclerops</i>) is known
under the name of yacaré, or jacquare, in South America.
Azara, the naturalist, tells us that the eggs of this animal
are white, rough, and as large as those of a goose; they
are deposited, to the number of sixty, in the sand, and
covered with dried grass. The Indians of Paraguay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
and other districts, esteem them as food, and also relish
the white and savoury flesh of this alligator, although
it is dry and coarse. Cayman is the Spanish word for
alligator, and, according to Walker, alligator is the
name chiefly used for the crocodile in America.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace thus describes an alligator hunt, as pursued
on the lakes in Mexiana, an island lying off the
mouth of the Amazon:—‘A number of negroes went into
the water with long poles, driving the animals to the
side, where others awaited them with harpoons and lassos.
Sometimes, the lasso was at once thrown over their
heads, or, if first harpooned, a lasso was then secured to
them, either over the head or the tail, and they were
easily dragged to the shore by the united force of ten
or twelve men. Another lasso was fixed, if necessary,
so as to fasten them at both ends; and, on being pulled
out of the water, a negro cautiously approached with an
axe, and cut a deep gash across the root of the tail, rendering
this formidable weapon useless; another blow
across the neck disabled the head; and the animal was
then left, and pursuit of another commenced, which was
speedily reduced to the same condition.</p>

<p>‘Sometimes the cord would break, or the harpoon
get loose, and the negroes had often to wade into the
water among the ferocious animals in a very hazardous
manner. They were from ten to eighteen feet long,
sometimes even twenty, with enormous mis-shapen
heads and fearful rows of long, sharp teeth. When a
number were out on the land, dead or dying, they were
cut open, and the fat, which accumulates in considerable
quantities about the intestines, was taken out, and made
up into packets in the skins of the smaller ones, taken
off for the purpose. After killing twelve or fifteen, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
overseer and his party went off to another lake at a
short distance, where the alligators were more plentiful,
and by night had killed nearly fifty. The next day
they killed twenty or thirty more, and got out the fat
from the others. In some of these lakes 100 alligators
have been killed in a few days; in the Amazon
or Para rivers it would be difficult to kill as many in
a year. The fat is boiled down into oil and burned in
lamps. It has rather a disagreeable smell, but not
worse than train-oil.’</p>

<p>The flesh of the land alligator, as it is termed by the
Malays (the <i>Hydrosaurus salvator</i>), which occasionally
attains the length of five or six feet, makes, it is said,
good eating, and is much esteemed by the natives for
its supposed restorative and invigorating properties.
At Manila, these creatures are regularly sold in the
markets, and fetch a good price; the dried skin is
readily bought by the Chinese, who use it in some of
their indescribable messes of gelatinous soup.</p>

<p>Another species eaten is the <i>Hydrosaurus giganteus</i>.
Like that of the <i>Iguanæ</i> of the New World, the flesh
of these saurians is delicate eating, and has been
compared to that of a very young sucking pig.</p>

<p>The eggs of all the different kinds of alligators, and
there are three or four distinct species abounding in the
Amazon and its tributary streams, are eaten by the
natives, though they have a very strong musky odour.
The largest species of alligator (<i>Jacare nigra</i>), reaches
a length of 15 or rarely 20 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace, in his <i>Travels</i>, records, that on one occasion,
the Indians on the Rio Negro supped off a young
alligator they had caught in a brook near, ‘but the
musty odour was so strong that I could not stomach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
it, and after getting down a bit of the tail, finished my
supper with mingau, or gruel of mandioc.’</p>

<p>Alligators are killed in great numbers in parts of the
river Amazon, for their fat, which is made into oil.</p>

<p>Hernandez states, that the flesh of the Axolotl, an
aquatic reptile, is very agreeable and wholesome. It is
the <i>Siren pisciformis</i> of Shaw; the <i>Menobranchus pisciformis</i>,
Harl. It is commonly sold in the markets of
Mexico. When dressed after the manner of stewed
eels, and served up, with a stimulating sauce, it is esteemed
a great luxury. The flesh of the sauve-garde or
common Teguixin of Brazil (<i>Teguixin monitor</i> of Gray,
<i>Teius Teguixin</i>) is eaten, and is said to be excellent.</p>

<p>The flesh of the common ada of Mr. Gray is accounted
excellent by the natives of Guiana, who compare
it to a fowl; its eggs are also in great request. It
is the <i>Thorictes dracæna</i>, Bibron; <i>La grande dragonne</i>,
Cuvier, and attains the length of four to six feet.</p>

<p>Some species of lizards are used as food in Burmah.
One of these especially, called pada, is stated not
to be inferior to a fowl,—this is probably the iguana.
Nearly every species of serpent is eaten there, after
the head has been cut off. All have a fishy taste. Some
few kinds, however, although the teeth are carefully
removed, cannot be used, as the flesh appears to be
poisonous.</p>

<p>The flesh of snakes is eaten by many in Dominica,
particularly by the French, some of whom are very
fond of it; but it is reckoned unwholesome, and to
occasion the leprosy.</p>

<p>A snake called, by the natives of Western Australia
wango, is particularly liked by them as food.</p>

<p>There is a very venomous yellow-bellied snake, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
five to six feet long, called locally dubyt, which is much
dreaded; but that is also eaten by them.</p>

<p>The formidable lance-headed viper, of the Leeward
Islands (<i>Trigonocephalus lanceolatus</i>), feeds chiefly on
birds, lizards, and rats. After swallowing their prey,
these snakes exhale a disgusting odour; this does not
prevent the negroes from eating their flesh, which
they find, it is said, free from any unpleasant flavour.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckland, in his interesting volume, <i>Curiosities
of Natural History</i>, says, he once had the opportunity
of tasting a boa-constrictor, that had been killed
by an accident, and came into his possession.</p>

<p>‘I tried the experiment,’ he observes, ‘and cooked a
bit of him; it tasted very like veal, the flesh being exceedingly
white and firm. If I had had nothing else,
and could have forgotten what I was eating, I could
easily have made a dinner of it.’</p>

<p>The flesh of serpents was held in high repute by the
ancients, medicinally; and, when properly prepared,
seems to have made a very agreeable article of diet,
corresponding with the turtle soup of the present day.
Even now, in the French tariff, vipers are subject to a
duty of 4<i>s.</i> the cwt.</p>

<p>In Guatemala, there is a popular belief, that lizards
eaten alive cure the cancer. The Indians are said to
have made this important discovery; and in 1780, the
subject was investigated by European physicians. I do
not find the remedy in the modern pharmacopœias, nevertheless,
the inhabitants of Amatitlan, the town where
the discovery was first made, still adhere to their belief
in its efficacy. The man who first eat a live oyster
or clam, was certainly a venturous fellow, but the eccentric
individual who allowed a live lizard to run down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
his throat, was infinitely more so. There is no accounting
for taste.</p>

<p>Probably some of our learned physiologists and medical
men may be able to explain the therapeutic effects.</p>

<p>Some of the tribes of Southern Guinea, eat the boa-constrictor,
or python, and consider it delicate food.
The more informed among them, however, regard the
practice as peculiarly heathenish. In Ceylon, the flesh
of the anaconda, which is said to devour travellers, is
much esteemed as food by some of the natives.</p>

<p>Who shall determine what is good eating? When we
have gone over so many delicacies, we must not be surprised
at men’s eating rattlesnakes, and pronouncing
them capital food. An English writer, who has recently
published a work entitled <i>A Ride over the Rocky Mountains
to Oregon and California</i>, in describing the journey
across the great desert, says:—</p>

<p>‘<i>12th July.</i>—Shot two prairie dogs. Jem killed a
hare and rattlesnake. They were all capital eating,
not excepting the snake, which the parson cooked, and
thought it as good as eel!’</p>

<p>The Australian aborigines, and some of the Kafir
tribes, commonly eat snakes roasted in the fire—and
stewed snakes may, for aught I know, be as good as
stewed eels.</p>

<p>The Italians regale themselves with a jelly made of
stewed vipers.</p>

<p>The Bushman of Africa catches serpents, not only as
an article of food, but to procure poison for his arrows.</p>

<p>Various reliable accounts before me prove that rattlesnakes
are not unfit for food, and may be placed
among the multifarious articles regarded by man as
delicacies of the table. The negroes eat the flesh of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the rattlesnake, as well as that of other serpents. When
the skin and intestines are removed, no bad odour remains.
A correspondent of the <i>Penny Magazine</i> thus
describes his experience of fried rattlesnakes, at a tavern
in Kaskaskia, a small town on the Mississippi. He finds
there a party of four or five travellers, who had been on
an exploring expedition:—</p>

<p>‘After a brief interview, they politely invited me to
partake of the supper they had already bespoken, informing
me, at the same time, that they considered
themselves peculiarly fortunate in having procured an
excellent dish,—in fact, a great delicacy—in a place
where they expected to meet with but indifferent fare.
What this great delicacy was, they did not attempt to
explain; and, having without hesitation accepted of their
invitation, I felt no inclination to make any farther inquiries.</p>

<p>‘When the hour of supper arrived, the principal dish—and,
indeed, almost the only one upon the table—appeared
to me to be a dish of good-sized eels fried. I being
the guest of my new acquaintances, had the honor of being
the first served with a plate of what the person who
presided called ‘Musical Jack.’ ‘Musical Jack,’ thought
I, is some species of eel peculiar to the Mississippi and
its tributary waters; and taking it for granted that it
was all right, I forthwith began to ply my knife and
fork. ‘Stop,’ said the individual that occupied the
bottom of the table, before I had swallowed two mouthfuls.
‘You, sir, have no idea, I presume, what you are
eating; and since you are our guest for the time being,
I think it but right that you should have no cause hereafter
to think yourself imposed upon. The dish before
you, which we familiarly call ‘Musical Jack,’ is composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
of rattlesnakes, which the hunter who accompanies us
in our tour of exploration was so fortunate to procure
for us this afternoon. It is far from the first time that
we have fared thus; and, although our own hunter
skinned, decapitated, and dressed the creatures, it was
only through dint of coaxing that our hostess was prevailed
upon to lend her frying-pan for so vile a purpose.’</p>

<p>‘Although curiosity had on many occasions prompted
me to taste strange and unsavoury dishes, I must confess
that never before did I feel such a loathing and
disgust as I did towards the victuals before me. I was
scarcely able to listen to the conclusion of this short address,
ere I found it prudent to hurry out of the room;
nor did I return till supper was over, and ‘Musical Jack’
had either been devoured or dismissed their presence.</p>

<p>‘As far as I recollect the circumstance, there was
nothing peculiar or disagreeable in the flavour of the
small quantity I ate; and when the subject was calmly
discussed on the following day, one of the party assured
me he was really partial to the meat of the rattlesnake,
although some of the other members of his party had
not been fully able to conquer their early-conceived antipathies
towards this snake; but that during their long
journey they had been occasionally prevailed upon to
make trial of a small quantity of the flesh, and were willing
to own that had they, been ignorant of its nature, they
should have pronounced it of a quality passably good.</p>

<p>‘Ever afterwards in my visits to Kaskaskia, I narrowly
examined every dish of a dubious character that
was placed before me, in order to satisfy myself that it
was not ‘Musical Jack.’’</p>

<p>Dr. Lang, in one of his works, gives us an account of
snake cooking in Australia:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>‘One of the black fellows took the snake, and placing
it on the branch of a tree, and striking it on the back
of the head repeatedly with a piece of wood, threw it
into the fire. The animal was not quite dead, for it
wriggled for a minute or two in the fire, and then became
very stiff and swollen, apparently from the expansion
of the gases imprisoned in its body. The black
fellow then drew it out of the fire, and with a knife cut
through the skin longitudinally on both sides of the
animal, from the head to the tail. He then coiled it up
as a sailor does a rope, and laid it again upon the fire,
turning it over again and again with a stick till he
thought it sufficiently done on all sides, and superintending
the process of cooking with all the interest
imaginable. When he thought it sufficiently roasted,
he thrust a stick into the coil, and laid it on the grass to
cool, and when cool enough to admit of handling, he
took it up again, wrung off its head and tail, which he
threw away, and then broke the rest of the animal by
the joints of the vertebræ into several pieces, one of
which he threw to the other black fellow, and another
he began eating himself with much apparent relish.
Neither Mr. Wade nor myself having ever previously
had the good fortune to witness the dressing of a snake
for dinner by the black natives, we were much interested
with the whole operation; and as the steam from
the roasting snake was by no means unsavoury, and
the flesh delicately white, we were each induced to try
a bit of it. It was not unpalatable by any means,
although rather fibrous and stringy like ling-fish. Mr.
Wade observed, that it reminded him of the taste of
eels; but as there was a strong prejudice against the
use of eels as an article of food in the west of Scotland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
in my boyhood, I had never tasted an eel, and
was therefore unable to testify to the correctness of this
observation. There was doubtless an equally strong
prejudice to get over in the case of a snake, and for an
hour or two after I had partaken of it, my stomach
was ever and anon on the point of insurrection at the
very idea of the thing; but, thinking it unmanly to
yield to such a feeling, I managed to keep it down.’</p>

<p>In a paper which I published in the <i>Journal of the
Society of Arts</i>, in October 1856, (vol. 4, p. 872,) I
entered very fully into a description of the various
snakes which are met with in different countries, poisonous
or harmless, and to that paper I would refer
those who wish to obtain descriptive details—scientific
or general—not bearing on the subject of food, at
present under our consideration.</p>

<p>The consumption of frogs is not, as is very often
supposed, confined to the French. It is now also indulged
in, to a considerable extent, by Americans;
and frogs appear to command a high price in the New
York market. An enthusiastic writer tries to convince
us, that the only objection to frogs as an article of diet
is a mere prejudice on the part of those who have
never eaten them. ‘In what respect are they worse than
eels? The frog who swallows young birds and ducklings
is surely as clean a feeder as the snake-like
creature that dines on dead dogs, and makes the celebrity
of the ait at Twickenham. Or is a frog less
savoury than a rat? And yet what a price was paid
for rats at the siege of Kars! If the garrison could
only have been supplied with lots of frogs—literal or
metaphorical—the Russians would never have taken
the place. Again, does a snail—the large escargot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
which people are so fond of in Paris—appear more
tempting than a frog? Or that animal picked out of
its shell with a pin, and called, in vulgar parlance, a
winkle. ‘Away, then,’ as indignant orators say, ‘away,
then, with this cant of false delicacy and squeamishness,
and the very first opportunity you have, <i>O lector fastidioso!</i>
order <i>A Dish of Frogs</i>. They are quite as
good as whitebait, when assisted by a flask of Rhenish.’</p>

<p>The <i>Athenæum</i>, also, recently came out in favour of
frogs. ‘There is no reason,’ it remarks, ‘why we
should eschew frogs and relish turtle; still less is there
for our eating one or two of the numerous edible
funguses, which our island produces, and condemning
all the rest.’</p>

<p>The green or edible frog (<i>Rana esculenta</i>) is a
native of Europe, some parts of Asia, and also of
Northern Africa. It is in high request on the Continent
for its flesh, the meat of the hind quarters, which
is alone used, being delicate and well tasted. In
Vienna, where the consumption of these frogs is very
considerable, they are preserved alive, and fattened in
froggeries (grenouillières) constructed for the express
purpose.</p>

<p>In America, the flesh of the huge bull-frog (<i>R.
pipiens</i>, Harl.; <i>R. mugiens</i>, Catesby,) is tender, white,
and affords excellent eating. Some bull-frogs weigh
as much as half-a-pound, but the hind legs are the only
parts used as food. They make excellent bait for the
larger cat-fish.</p>

<p>In the Antilles, another huge bull-frog is reared in
a state of domestication for the table. It is the <i>Rana
ocellata</i>, Linn; <i>R. gigas</i> of Spix; <i>Cystignathus ocellatus</i>,
Wagler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>Toads seem also to be eaten by the French, though
unwittingly. Professor Dumeril used to relate, in his
lectures at the Jardin des Plantes, that the frogs brought
to the markets in Paris are caught in the stagnant
waters round Montmorenci, in the Bois de Vincennes,
Bois de Boulogne, &amp;c. The people employed in this
traffic separate the hind quarters and legs of the frogs
from the body, denude them of their skin, arrange
them on skewers, as larks are done in this country, and
then bring them in that state to market. In seeking
for frogs, these dealers often meet with toads, which
they do not reject, but prepare them in the same way
as they would frogs; and, as it is impossible to determine
whether the hind quarters of these creatures,
after the skin is stripped off, belong to frogs or toads, it
continually happen that great numbers of the supposed
frogs sold in Paris for food are actually toads.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>This account of the mode of bringing the frogs to
market, in Paris, does not tally with that given by my
friend, Mr. F. T. Buckland, in his <i>Curiosities of Natural
History</i>; he says:—</p>

<p>‘In France, frogs are considered a luxury, as any
<i>bon vivant</i> ordering a dish of them at the <i>Trois Frères</i>,
at Paris, may, by the long price, speedily ascertain.
Not wishing to try such an expensive experiment in
gastronomy, I went to the large market in the Faubourg
St. Germain, and enquired for frogs. I was
referred to a stately-looking dame at a fish-stall, who
produced a box nearly full of them, huddling and
crawling about, and occasionally croaking as though
aware of the fate to which they were destined. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
price fixed was two a penny, and having ordered a
dish to be prepared, the <i>Dame de la Halle</i> dived her
hand in among them, and having secured her victim
by the hind legs, she severed him in twain with a sharp
knife; the legs, minus skin, still struggling, were placed on
a dish; and the head, with the fore-legs affixed, retained
life and motion, and performed such motions that the
operation became painful to look at. These legs were
afterwards cooked at the <i>restaurateur’s</i>, being served up
fried in bread crumbs, as larks are in England; and
most excellent eating they were, tasting more like the
delicate flesh of the rabbit than anything else I can
think of. I afterwards tried a dish of the common
English frog, but his flesh is not so white nor so tender
as that of his French brother.’</p>

<p>The Chinese seem also to appreciate frogs, for Mr.
Fortune, in describing a Chinese market, says—</p>

<p>‘Frogs seemed much in demand. They are brought to
market in tubs and baskets, and the vender employs himself
in skinning them as he sits making sales. He is extremely
expert at this part of his business. He takes
up the frog in his left hand, and with a knife, which he
holds in his right, chops off the fore part of its head.
The skin is then drawn back over the body and down
to the feet, which are chopped off and thrown away.
The poor frog, still alive, but headless, skinless, and
feetless, is then thrown into another tub, and the operation
is repeated on the rest in the same way. Every
now and then the artist lays down his knife, and takes
up his scales to weigh these animals for his customers,
and make his sales. Everything in this civilised country,
whether it be gold or silver, geese or frogs, is sold by
weight.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>According to Seba and Madame Merian, the negroes
eat the flesh of the Surinam toad (<i>Pipa Surinamensis</i>).</p>

<p>Frogs or toads of an enormous size (<i>Crapaux</i>) are
very numerous in Dominica, and much esteemed as an
article of food; the flesh, when fricasseed, being preferred
by the English, as well as French, to chickens;
and, when made into soup, recommended for the sick,
especially in consumptive cases.</p>

<p>Wallace, in his <i>Travels on the Amazon</i>, tells us, ‘his
Indians went several times early in the morning to the
gapo to catch frogs, which they obtained in great numbers,
stringing them on a sipo, and boiling them entire,
entrails and all, and devoured them with much gusto.
The frogs are mottled of various colours, have dilated
toes, and are called jui.’</p>

<p>The eating of frogs seems to be indulged in in the
Philippines, for a traveller tells us that—</p>

<p>‘After the rains there may generally be procured,
by those who like them, frogs, which are taken from
the ditch round the walls in great numbers, and are then
fat and in good condition for eating, making a very
favourite curry of some of the Europeans, their flesh
being very tender.’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c8">FISH.</h2>
</div>


<p>More than two-thirds of our globe being covered by
the waters of the ocean, and of the remaining third a
great part being washed by extensive rivers, or occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
by lakes, ponds, or marshes, these watery realms,
teeming with life, furnish man with a great variety of
food. Some of these have already passed under consideration
in the reptilia, and others in the great class
mammalia, as seals, morses, and manatees, which can remain
at no great distance from the sea, together
with whales, which never leave it, though constantly
obliged, by the nature of their respiration, to seek its
surface.</p>

<p>Mollusca, crustacea, annelides, and zoophytes are
almost peculiar to this element, having but few scattered
representatives on earth; but, amidst all its varied inhabitants,
there are none more exclusively confined to
its realms, none that rule them with such absolute sway,
none more remarkable for number, variety of form,
beauty of colour, and, above all, for the infinite advantages
which they yield to man, than the great class of
fishes. In fact, their evident superiority has caused
their name to pass as a general appellation to all the
inhabitants of the deep. Whales are called fish, crabs
are called shell-fish, and the same term is used to denote
oysters; though the first are mammalia, the second
articulata, and the third mollusca.</p>

<p>Milton has well described the abundance of fish—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent0">——‘Each creek and bay,</div>

<p>The modes of preserving fish are various; they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
salted and dried, smoked and potted, baked or marinated,
preserved in oil, and pounded in a dry mass.</p>

<p>Several savage nations possess the art of preparing
fish in a great variety of ways, even as a kind of flour,
bread, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Dr. Davy, commenting upon the remarkable facts
respecting the exemption of fish-eating persons from
certain diseases, suggests that there is undoubtedly
something in the composition of fish which is not common
to other articles of food, whether vegetable or
animal. He believes this consists of iodine. He says,
that in all instances in which he sought for this substance
in <i>sea fish</i> he has found it; and also traces of
it in migratory fish, but not in <i>fresh-water fish</i>.</p>

<p>The trials he made were limited to red gurnard,
mackerel, haddock, common cod, whiting, sole, ling,
herring, pilchard, salmon, sea-trout, smelt, and trout.</p>

<p>The experiment was as follows.—He dried and charred,
lixiviated, reduced to ashes, and again washed
from a quarter of a pound to a pound of fish.</p>

<p>A good deal of limy matter was afforded from the
washings of the charcoal of the sea fish.</p>

<p>The saline matter was principally common salt, had
a pretty strong alkaline reaction, and by the blue hue
produced by starch and <i>aqua regia</i>, afforded a clear
proof of the presence of iodine. Only a slight trace
was detected in the fresh-water salmon, sea-trout, and
smelt. In the spent salmon descending to the sea, only
just a perceptible trace was observable, and no trace in
either parr or trout.</p>

<p>Dr. Davy states further, that he has detected it in an
unmistakable manner in the common shrimp; also in the
cockle, mussel, oyster, crab, &amp;c.; nor is this remarkable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
considering that it enters into the greater part of the
food of fishes.</p>

<p>He observes, also, that cod liver oil is well established
as an alterative or cure of pulmonary consumption, and
as this oil contains iodine, the inference is, that sea fish,
generally, may be alike beneficial. The practical application
of this inquiry is obvious. A suggestion is
also made as to the efficacy of drying fish, even without
salt, the drying being complete to the exclusion of
even hydroscopic water, for the use of the explorer and
traveller.</p>

<p>The inference as to the salutary effects of fish
depending on the presence of iodine, in the prevention
of tubercular disease, might be extended to <i>goitre</i>,
which it is known has already yielded to iodine. This
formidable complaint appears to be completely unknown
to the inhabitants of sea-ports and sea-coasts. Respecting
another and concluding question, viz., the different
parts of fish, it is to be remarked that, so far as experiments
have gone, the effects will not be the same
from all parts of the fish, because the inorganic elements
are not the same. The examples chosen are the
liver, muscle, roe, or melt. In the ash of the liver and
muscle of sea-fish, Dr. Davy always found a large
proportion of saline matter, common salt, abounding,
with a minute portion of iodine, rather more in the
liver than the muscle, and free alkali, or alkali in a
state to occasion an alkaline reaction, as denoted by
test-paper; whilst in the roe or melt there has been
detected very little saline matter, no trace of iodine,
nor of free alkali; on the contrary, a free acid, viz.,
phosphorus, analogous to what occurs in the yolk of
an egg, and in consequence of which it is very difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
to digest either the roe or melt of a fish, or the
yolk of an egg. The same conclusion on the same
ground is applicable to fresh-water fish, viz., the absence
of iodine.</p>

<p>A very common North American dish is chowder,
which is thus prepared:—</p>

<p>Fry brown several slices of pork; cut each fish into
five or six pieces; flour, and place a layer of them
in your pork fat; sprinkle on a little pepper and salt;
add cloves, mace, and sliced onions; if liked, lay on
bits of the fried pork, and crackers soaked in cold
water. Repeat this till you put in all the fish; turn
on water just sufficient to cover them, and put on a
heated bake pan lid. After stewing about 20 minutes,
take up the fish, and mix two teaspoonfuls of flour
with a little water, and stir it into the gravy, adding
a little pepper and butter. A tumbler of wine, catsup,
and spices will improve it. Cod and bass make the
best chowder. In making clam chowder, the hard
part of the clam should be cut off and rejected.</p>

<p>Fish glue consists almost wholly of gelatine; 100
grains of good dry isinglass, containing rather more
than 98 of matter soluble in water.</p>

<p>Isinglass may be obtained from many fish. Jackson
states, that the sounds of cod afford it; and
that the lakes of America abound with fish, from
which the very finest isinglass may be obtained. This
substance is best prepared in summer, as frost impairs
the colour, and deprives it of weight and of gelatinous
principle.</p>

<p>It is made into jellies and blanc-manger, by the cook
and confectioner, and with some sort of balsam, spread
on silk, forms the court-plaister of the shops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Fish maws are the dried stomachs of fishes, like our
cod’s sounds, which being considered a great luxury
by the Chinese, and as possessing strengthening and
aphrodisiac properties, are brought over in the junks
from the Indian islands.</p>

<p>Crawford states, that they often fetch upwards of £14
per cwt. in the Canton market. The exports of fish
maws from Bombay average from 1500 to 2500 cwts.
per annum; from Madras, about 50 cwts.; and from
Bengal about 4,000 lbs.</p>

<p>Caviar is the common name for a preparation of
the dried spawn, or salted roe of fish. The black
caviar is made from the roe of sturgeon, and a single
large fish will sometimes yield as much as 120 lbs.
of roe. A cheaper and less prized red kind is obtained
from the roe of the gray mullet, and some of
the carp species, which are common in the rivers, and
on the shores of the Black Sea. Caviar is principally
consumed in Russia, Germany, and Italy, by the
Greeks, during their long fasts, and also in small
quantities in England. Inferior caviar is made into
small, dry cakes. One thousand cwt. of caviar has
been shipped from Odessa in a single season, and
from Astracan, about 30,000 barrels. The produce
of caviar from the Caspian sea, some years ago, was
as much as a million and a half of pounds.</p>

<p>A preparation called botargo is made on the coasts of
the Mediterranean from the spawn of a kind of fine
mullet of a red color. The best is said to be made at
Tunis, but it is also common in Sicily.</p>

<p>The dried roe of an enormous species of shad, which
frequents the great river of Siak in Sumatra, constitutes
an article of commerce in the East. According to Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Richardson, very good bread may be made from the
roe of the pollack, an ocean fish (<i>Gadus pollachius</i>),
found on both sides of the Atlantic, and in the Indian
seas: on the British coasts it is often termed the cod-fish;
and when young, the whiting pollack. In North
America, this fish is so plentiful that it is salted and
sold by the quintal like cod or ling.</p>

<p>The Chinook Indians of the Columbia rivers are very
fond of herrings’ roes, which they collect in the following
manner:—They sink cedar branches to the bottom
of the river, in shallow places, by placing upon them a
few heavy stones, taking care not to cover the green
foliage, as the fish prefer spawning on anything green,
and they literally cover all the branches by next morning
with spawn. The Indians wash this off in their water-proof
baskets, to the bottom of which it sinks; this is
squeezed by the hand into little balls and then dried,
and is very palatable.</p>

<p>The large roe of the Callipeva fish, already alluded to,
is considered a delicacy in the West Indies. The mode
of curing it differs widely from that in which the roe
of the sturgeon and the sterlet is prepared.</p>

<p>The following is the account given by Goldsmith, in
his <i>History of the Earth and Animated Nature</i>, of the
way in which the latter is manufactured:—</p>

<p>‘They take the spawn, and freeing it from the small
membranes that connect it together, they wash it with
vinegar, and afterwards spread it to dry upon a table;
they then put it into a vessel with salt, breaking the
spawn with their hands, and not with a pestle. This
done, they put it into a canvas bag, letting the liquor
drain from it. Lastly, they put it into a tub with holes
at the bottom, so that if there be any moisture still remaining,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
it may run out; then it is pressed down and
covered up for use.’</p>

<p>Very different is the manner adopted by the Spaniards
in Central America in curing the roe of the callipeva.
They do it in this wise:—First, they rub the roe well
with salt and a little nitre, then they put a number of
them one upon another, and compress them by means
of a heavy weight. After this, they make an altar of
green boughs, covering the top also with green branches
traversing each other. The inside being filled with
straw and fresh leaves, which are ignited, they place
the roes on the top and cover them well up likewise
with green boughs. They are allowed to remain there
six or seven days, during which time the fire keeps
smouldering and sending up a thick smoke which is concentrated
upon the roes by the upper layer of branches.
This they call barbecuing. The membraneous covering
of the roe is not taken off, consequently it will keep
for a long time, the air being entirely excluded from it.
When the roe is eaten, it should be cut in very thin
slices. The outer coating should not be taken off, but
rubbed clean with a dry napkin.</p>

<p>In New Caledonia, the natives are said to eat the roe
of the <i>Salmo scouleri</i> mixed with rancid oil, which, in
their estimation, gives the savoury morsel additional
flavour. The smell alone is said by a traveller to be
so nauseous as to prevent any but a native from partaking
of it, unless severely pressed with hunger.</p>

<p>Dr. Richardson tells us that, when well bruised and
mixed with a little flour, the roe of the methy (<i>Lotha
maculosa</i>) can be baked into very good biscuits, which
are used in the fur countries as tea-bread.</p>

<p>Among the Anglo-Saxons and in the middle ages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
fish of almost every kind were eaten, including many
now thought unwholesome. Whales, when accidentally
taken on our coasts, appear in those early times to
have been also salted for food; an allowance is entered,
amongst the other expenses of John de Lee, Sheriff of
Essex and Herts, for guarding a whale taken off Mersey
Island; for emptying of casks to put it in; for salt to
salt it; and for carrying it to the court of Stamford.</p>

<p>Brand states porpoises to have been sold for food in
the Newcastle market as late as 1575. Sturgeon, and
in the northern nations, whales, were early reserved as
royalties; and in England, whales and great sturgeons
taken in the sea were, by the Act 17 Edward II., to
be the king’s, except in certain privileged places. In
the dinner bills of the Goldsmiths’ Company, besides
the ordinary fish, we find blote-fish, jowls and middles
of sturgeons, salt lampreys, congers, pike, bream, bass,
tench, and chub, a seal, and porpoise mentioned.</p>

<p>The red herring is included in an inquisition 28 Henry
III.; and the Act of Parliament 31 Edward III., called
the <i>Statute of Herrings</i>, shows the great request in
which this most useful article of food was then held by
the English.</p>

<p>Herrings by the <i>last</i>, or 10,000, were sent from Hull
to London, and from Yarmouth to Hull, as also red
herrings, in the time of Edward I.</p>

<p>The tariff of prices of fish, fixed by the same king, acquaints
us with the rates at which the various kinds
were sold. It limits the best soles to 3<i>d.</i> per dozen;
the best turbot to 6<i>d</i>.; the best mackerel in Lent to 1<i>d.</i>
each; the best pickled herrings to twenty the penny;
fresh oysters to 2<i>d.</i> per gallon; a quarter of a hundred
of the best eels to 2<i>d.</i>; and other fish in proportion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
‘Congers, lampreys, and sea-hogs,’ are enumerated.
Mackerel are first mentioned in 1247, as allowed to
certain religions on the third day of the Rogation, and
are noticed as a metropolitan cry in the ballad of
<i>London Lickpenny</i>;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and ‘stokfish, salt fische, whyt
herring, réde herring, salt salmon, salt sturgeon, salt
eels, &amp;c.,’ are mentioned as common provisions in the
Earl of Northumberland’s household, in the reign of
Henry VII.; and then formed part of every meal.
Thus, ‘for my Lord and Ladie’s table,’ is to be bought,
‘ij pecys of salt fische, vj pecys of salt fische, vj becormed
herryng, iiij white herryng, or a dish of sproots.’ And
these breakfasts of salt fish extended through the household,
whose separate departments, and the way they were
to be served with this article, both in and out of Lent, are
particularized, and afford a curious picture of the style
of living in the ancient Catholic periods, and of the
amazing use and consumption of salt-fish. In short, it
formed part of the allowances of the King and the Nobility,
of monastic establishments, and of all ranks of society.</p>

<p>The fish ordinaries still kept up at the taverns at
Billingsgate, where all kinds of fish in season may be
partaken of for a moderate charge at fixed hours, are
but a continuation of a very old practice, although the
locality is removed; for Stow tells us that Knightrider street,
was famous ‘<i>for fish and fish dinners</i>;’ and he
derives the name of Friday-street from fishmongers
dwelling there and serving the <i>Friday</i> markets.</p>

<p>Philip II. of Spain, the consort of Queen Mary gave
a whimsical reason for not eating fish. ‘They are,’
said he, ‘nothing but element congealed, or a jelly of
water.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>The broth or jelly of fish, which is usually thrown
away, will be found one of the most nourishing animal
jellies that can be obtained. It is a pity that those who
find it difficult to obtain a sufficiency of nourishing food
should not be aware of this, as they might thereby
make a second meal of what otherwise yields but one.
Supposing a poor family to buy a dinner of plaice,
which is a cheap fish—the plaice would be boiled and
the meat of the fish eaten, and the liquor and bones of
the fish thrown away. Now, let the good housewife
put the remains of the fish into the liquor and boil for
a couple of hours, and she will find she has something
in her pot, which, when strained off, will be as good to
her as much of that which is sold in the shops as
‘gelatine.’ This she may use as a simple broth, or she
may thicken it with rice, and flavor it with onion and
pepper, and have a nourishing and satisfying meal;
or, should she have an invalid in her family, one-third
of milk added and warmed with it, would be nourishing
and restoring.</p>

<p>Dr. Davy, in his <i>Angler and his Friend</i>, tells us,
‘There is much nourishment in fish, little less than in
butcher’s meat, weight for weight; and in effect it may
be more nourishing, considering how, from its softer
fibre, fish is more easily digested. Moreover, there is,
I find, in fish—sea-fish—a substance which does not
exist in the flesh of land-animals, viz., iodine—a substance
which may have a beneficial effect on the health,
and tend to prevent scrofulous and tubercular disease,
the latter in the form of pulmonary consumption, one
of the most cruel and fatal with which civilized society,
and the highly educated and refined are afflicted. Comparative
trials prove that, in the majority of fish, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
proportion of solid matter—that is, the matter which
remains after perfect desiccation, or the expulsion of the
aqueous part—is little inferior to that of the several
kinds of butcher’s meat, game or poultry. And, if we
give our attention to classes of people—classed as to
quality of food they principally subsist on—we find that
the ichthyophagous class are especially strong, healthy,
and prolific. In no class than that of fishers do we see
larger families, handsomer women, or more robust and
active men, or greater exemption from maladies just
alluded to.’</p>

<p>In the pastry cooks’ shops of Russia, the tempting
morsel offered to Russian appetites is the <i>piroga</i>, an
oily fish-cake. Little benches are ranged round tables,
on which the favourite dainty is placed, covered over
with an oily canvass, for it must be eaten hot. A large
pot of green oil and a stand of salt are in readiness,
and, as soon as a purchaser demands a piroga, it is withdrawn
from its cover, plunged into the oil, sprinkled
with salt, and presented dripping to the delighted
Muscovite.</p>

<p>‘In some countries, fish, when tainted or even putrid
is preferred to that which is fresh. The inhabitants of
the banks of the Senegal and Orange rivers pound some
small fish of the size of sprats in a wooden mortar, as
they are taken from the stream, and afterwards make
them up into conical lumps, like our sugar-loaves,
which they dry in the sun. In this state, they soon
become slightly decomposed, and give out a most unpleasant
odour; notwithstanding which, these people
consider them a luxury, and eat them dissolved in
water, mixed with their kouskoussoo, or dough. Fish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
prepared in a somewhat similar manner, is eaten by
the Indians on the banks of the Orinoco.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>’</p>

<p>In Beloochistan, the inhabitants feed almost entirely
on fish; and their cattle are also fed on dried fish and
dates mixed together.</p>

<p>No one who has observed a boiled fish upon the table
can have passed unremarked the spinal column with its
upward and downward processes, and the four transverse
strips of flesh, adjusted alternately in different directions
with strong semi-transparent tendons between.
The spinous processes, proceeding from the vertebræ
upward, support the dorsal fins, whilst the transverse
processes downward, with curved bones, encircle partially
the bulk of the body. Without being ribs, these
latter resemble ribs. Those placed far forward represent
the proper thoracic ribs of fishes, but have no
direct connexion with the spine. There are other rib-like
bones behind. These are abdominal appendages;
very numerous in some fishes, such as the herrings,
and very few,—and those few conveniently large,—in
others, such as the perches and labruses. They are
wanting in several of the osseous tribes, such as the
Diodons and Tetradons, and are altogether non-existent
in the cartilaginous fishes. It is from this fact—that so
many of the West Indian fishes belong to the Percoid
and Labroid families—that persons are so seldom troubled
with what are called by the cook, ‘bony fishes.’—Hence,
very little annoyance is experienced from the
bones in the fish dishes there.</p>

<p>Very serious consequences have often arisen from
eating fish or molluscs, which are poisonous or in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
unhealthy state. All Ostraceans, Diodons, and Tetradons,
are deleterious, and are to be treated as objectionable,
if not absolutely dangerous fishes.</p>

<p>Every one acquainted with the bad reputation of
the common mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) knows also the
symptoms produced by the hurtful qualities of it, even
when cooked—for it is not generally, like the oyster,
eaten raw.</p>

<p>The mussels would seem to owe this injurious quality
to feeding on the spawn of the star-fish (<i>Asteria</i>).</p>

<p>There are many persons who break out with irritative
eruptions after eating certain descriptions of shell-fish,
though they injure no other idiosyncrasies—others
again are subject to diarrhœa from fish-diet, though
the same food be harmless to other persons.</p>

<p>Almost all fishes are unwholesome at certain seasons,
and hence the regulations laid down for the vend of
oysters, lobsters, salmon, &amp;c., only in prescribed periods.
Science, in searching to determine the reason why this is
the case, encounters certain wholesale occurrences which
are due to some general, but at the same time, very
specific causes. Mackerel sold in the New York market
occasionally produce poisonous effects; and London is
sometimes supplied with unwholesome salmon in large
quantities.</p>

<p>Dr. Burroughs, in a paper on <i>Poisonous Fishes</i>, published
last year in a Jamaica journal, remarks:</p>

<p>‘There are five obvious circumstances to be taken into
consideration in the incidents of fish-poison.</p>

<p>‘1st. The existence of a <i>sanies</i>, from some disorder
indicated in the living tissues of the animal.</p>

<p>‘2ndly. A natural deleteriousness in the flesh, without
reference to a state of disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>‘3rdly. The adventitious presence of something deleterious
in the fish, from the food recently eaten.</p>

<p>‘4thly. The injury resulting from cooking fish with
such large organs as the liver unextracted,—the liver
being at all times dangerous as food in some particular
fishes.</p>

<p>‘5thly. The poisonous putrefaction known to prevail
in some fishes after 24 hours keeping. Morbid action
set up in the healthy animal body that receives the
putrefactive poison being indicated by oppression,
nausea, giddiness, and general prostration.’</p>

<p>We might add a 6th,—the known existence of an
irritating fluid,—issuing from the surface of some fishes
of peculiar structure.</p>

<p>We know that fish liver contains an enormous quantity
of oil; that fish oil is an important article of commerce,
and fish liver oil is a valuable medicine; but we
know beside, that these oils, in a corrupt state, are
active poisons. Hence, we may infer that the liver is
a great operator in the injury done by the deleterious
fishes, and if we but knew all the genera in which the
gall bladder is wanting, we might arrive at some rule
for estimating the possible development of those prejudicial
fluids that mingle from the liver with fish-flesh
in cooking.</p>

<p>We must not overlook, when speaking of fish-liver,
the adventure of Tobias and the Angel at the River
Tigris, in chap. vi. of the Apocryphal Tobit. The
heart and liver of the fish they took were a charm
against evil spirits, and the gall was a salve for blind
eyes; the one was used successfully in the nuptial
chamber of Sarah, the daughter of Ragual, and the other
as an ointment in restoring the sight of the blind Tobit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
The two incidents are thus related. Ch. viii.—‘Tobias
took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and
the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith—the
which smell when the evil spirit had smelled,
he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel
bound him.’ Ch. xi.—‘Tobit stumbled, and his Son
Tobias ran unto him, and strake of the gall on his
Father’s eyes, and when his eyes began to smart, he
rubbed them, and the whiteness pilled away from the
corners of his eyes.’</p>

<p>There are but few natural orders of fishes—and
they divide themselves for the purposes of our enquiry
chiefly into the <i>Acanthopterygii</i>, or those that
possess bony skeletons, with prickly, spinous processes
on the dorsal fins, such as the perch, the mullet,
and the gurnard; the <i>Malacopterygii</i>, or soft-finned
fishes, including the carp, the salmon, &amp;c.; and the
<i>Chondropterygii</i>, with cartilaginous spines and bones,
embracing such fish as the sturgeon, shark, and
skate. Instead of describing or specifying them in
consecutive order, it will perhaps be better to take
a glance at the fishes of different seas, at least, as
far as they are held in any repute as food. Many
of the most common must, however, be passed over
without notice.</p>

<p>It is strange how little attention, (comparatively
speaking,) is paid even to our coast fisheries, and especially
those of our colonies. Fisheries have been called
the agriculture of the sea. Raleigh attributes the
wealth and power of Holland, not to its commerce
or carrying trade, but to its fisheries. Mirabeau was
of the like opinion; De Witt held the same; and
Franklin seemed to prefer the fisheries of America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
to agriculture itself. A great nursery of the marine
is by this means best supported, from whence a constant
supply of men, inured to the perils of the sea
and the inclemency of the weather, is always ready
for the maritime service of their country. Fishing
has been celebrated from the earliest times, as being
the prelude, and if I may be allowed the expression,
the apprenticeship of navigation; offering, from the
line to the harpoon, more amusement with less fatigue
than perhaps any other species of pursuit, and occupying
the smallest boat up to ships of great burthen;
thus drawing forth the means of subsistence and
profit to an infinite number of persons.</p>

<p>The ocean fish are generally very dry eating.</p>

<p>In eating the flesh of the bonito, it is necessary to
lard it well, as its flesh is very dry.</p>

<p>The flesh of the tunny of the Atlantic is something
like veal, but dryer and more firm.</p>

<p>That of the dolphin was formerly held in great esteem.
It is also, however, very dry and insipid; the
best parts are those near the head. It is seldom eaten
now at sea, except when the fish caught happens to be
young and tender.</p>

<p>In the Maldive Islands, the bonito is preserved in
the following manner:—</p>

<p>The back bone is taken out, the fish laid in the
shade, and occasionally sprinkled with sea water. After
a certain period has elapsed, the fish is wrapped up in
cocoa-nut leaves, and buried in sand, where it becomes
hard. Fish thus prepared is known in Ceylon, and perhaps
over all India, by the name of <i>cummelmums</i>. The
pieces of this fish brought to the market have a horny
hardness. It is rasped upon rice to render it savoury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>The Havana is, I believe, the only place where the
flesh of the shark is exposed for sale in the markets,
although it is often tasted at sea by the curious.</p>

<p>The shark, judging by an European palate, is not
good eating; the flesh is dry and of an acid taste. The
fins and tail are, however, very glutinous, and are the
portions most relished by the seamen; and dried, they
form an article of commerce to China, where they are
used in soups, and considered an excellent aphrodisiac.</p>

<p>‘How thankful we ought to be to a bountiful Providence,
who has created all things for us richly to enjoy,’
observed an alderman at the last great city dinner, whilst
sumptuously regaling on turtle soup, crimped cod, with
oyster sauce, and other delicacies. ‘The beasts of the
earth, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea,’ he
continued, ‘were all created for the use of man.’</p>

<p>‘Very true,’ replied his next friend, ‘but if you had
witnessed the hair-breadth escape which I experienced
of being devoured alive by a shark, when in the West
Indies, you would have been satisfied that the horrible
monster entertained just the opposite opinion. He believed
that man was created for him!’</p>

<p>Sharks, which are very numerous there, form a common
article of food with the Gold Coast negroes, and
hippopotami and alligators are occasionally eaten.</p>

<p>Mr. George Bennett informs us, that ‘the shark is
eaten eagerly by the natives of the Polynesian Islands;
and I have often seen them feasting on it in a raw
state, when they gorge themselves to such an excess as
to occasion vomiting.’</p>

<p>It is not an unfrequent source of illness among these
islanders, and they suffer so much in consequence, as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
lead them to suppose that their dissolution is nigh: but
they cannot be persuaded that the eating of raw fish is
the cause. An emetic soon removes the symptoms by
removing the cause, and the sufferer considers the cure
as almost miraculous. Sharks are caught on the New
Zealand shores in great numbers, during the months of
November, December, and January, by the natives,
who use them as an article of food.</p>

<p>Shark hunting is most exciting sport.</p>

<p>He who has hooked the fish holds tight—like grim
Death on his victim; and if you watch his face you
will see powerful indication of excitement, mental and
muscular; his teeth are set, his colour is heightened,
the perspiration starts on his brow, while something
like an oath slips through his lips as the cord, strained
to the utmost, cuts into the skin of his empurpled fingers:
he invokes aid, and with his feet jammed against
stretcher, thwart, or gunwale, gradually shortens his
hold. Meanwhile, the others, seizing lance and gaff-hook,
stand by to assist the overtasked line, as the
monster, darting hither and thither in silvery lightnings
beneath the translucent wave, is drawn nearer and
nearer the surface. ‘My eyes, he’s a whopper!’ cries
the excited young boatman. ‘He’s off!’ shouts another,
as the shark makes a desperate plunge under the boat,
and the line, dragged through the hands of the holder,
is again suddenly slackened. ‘He’s all right, never
fear—belay your line a bit, sir, and look here,’ says
the old fisherman. And sure enough there is the
huge fish clearly visible, about ten feet under the keel
of the boat, and from stem to stern about the same
length as herself. ‘Now, sir, let’s have him up.’
And the instant the line is taut, the shark shoots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
upwards, his broad snout showing above the surface,
close to the boat. Then comes a scene of activity and
animation indeed. The fish, executing a series of
summersaults, and spinning, gets the line into a hundred
twists, and if once he succeed in bringing it
across his jaws above the chain links—adieu to both
fish and tackle. But, in the midst of a shower-bath,
splashed up by the broad tail of the shark, both lance
and gaff are hard at work. He is speared through
and through, his giant struggles throwing waves of
bloody water over the gunwales of the little boat;
the gaffs are hooked through his tough skin, or
within his jaws—for he has no gills to lay hold on;
a shower of blows from axe, stretcher, or tiller, falls
on his devoted head, and, if not considered too large,
heavy, or dangerous, he is lugged manfully into the
centre of the boat, and, threshing right and left with
his tail to the last, is soon dispatched. A smart blow
a few inches above the snout is more instantly fatal
than the deepest stab. The school-shark is dealt with
as above. But if the ‘grey-nurse,’ or old solitary
shark be hooked, the cable is cut, or the grapnel
hauled on board, and he is allowed to tow the boat
as he darts away with the line. The tables, however,
are soon turned upon him; and after being
played (as this cruel operation in fishing is blandly
styled) for a while, until some portion of his vast
strength is exhausted, the line is drawn over a roller
in the stern of the boat, the oars are set to work,
and, towed instead of towing, the shark is drawn
into some shallow cove near the shore, where his bodily
powers avail him less than in deeper water; and
after a fierce resistance, and some little risk to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
assailants, he falls a victim to their attack. Man has
as innate an horror of a shark as he has of a snake,
and he who has frequented tropical climates, felt the
absolute necessity of bathing, had his diurnal plunge
embittered by the haunting idea of the vicinity of
one of these sea-pests, and has occasionally been harrowed
by accidents arising from their voracity—feels
this antipathy with double force. There is, therefore,
a species of delightful fury, a savage excitement,
experienced by the shark-hunter, that has no affinity
with the philosophy of Old Isaak’s gentle art.
He revels in the animated indulgence of that cruelty
which is inherent in the child of wrath; and the
stings of conscience are blunted by the conviction
that it is an act of justice, of retribution, of duty,
he is engaged in, not one of wanton barbarity. These
were precisely my own sensations when, drenched to
the skin with showers of salt water, scorched to blisters
by the burning sun, excoriated as to my hands,
covered with blood, and oil, and dirt, and breathless
with exertion, I contemplated the corpse of my first
shark. Tiger-hunting is a more princely pastime;
boar-hunting in Bengal Proper the finest sport in the
world; fox-hunting an Englishman’s birthright; the
chase of the moose is excellent for young men strong
enough to drag a pair of snow shoes five feet long
upon their toes; and Mr. Gordon Cumming tells you
how man may follow the bent of his organ of destructiveness
on the gigantic beasts of South Africa: shark-fishing
is merely the best sport to be had in New
South Wales; and affords a wholesome stimulation to
the torpid action of life in Sydney. The humane or
utilitarian reader will be glad to hear that the shark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
is not utterly useless after death. The professional
fishermen extract a considerable quantity of excellent oil
from the liver; and the fins cut off, cured, and packed,
become an article of trade with China—whose people,
for reasons best known to themselves, delight in gelatinous
food. The most hideous to behold of the shark
tribe is the wobegong, or woe-begone as the fishermen
call it. Tiger-shark is another of the names of
this fish. His broad back is spotted over with leopard-like
marks; the belly is of a yellowish white; but to
describe minutely so frightful a monster would be a
difficult and ungracious task. Fancy a bloated toad,
elongated to the extent of six or seven feet, and
weighing some 20 stone; then cut off his legs, and you
have a flattering likeness of the wobegong—two of
which we killed this day. A heavy sluggish fish, he
lies in wait for his prey at the edge of some reef of
rocks, or bank of sea-weed; swallows the bait indolently;
appears but little sensible to the titillation of
the barbed hook, and is lugged hand over hand to the
slaughter without much trouble or resistance. Neither
lance nor gaff will penetrate his tough hide, but a blow
on the head with an axe proves instantly fatal.’</p>

<p>The schnapper affords a long and strong pull at the
line; and is considered by the colonists as one of their
best table fish. ‘We killed one to-day,’ writes a correspondent,
‘weighing 21 lbs. The flat-head is half buried
in the sand at the bottom, but bites freely; and is,
in my mind, a much better fish than the former. Our
fishing-basket of this day comprised nine sharks, four
schnappers, and about 40 flat-heads.’</p>

<p>The picked shark (<i>Galeus acanthias</i>) is very common
about the coasts of Scotland, where it is taken in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
order to be prepared for sale, by splitting and drying;
and is then much used as food among the poorer
classes.</p>

<p>In some parts of Scotland the large spotted dog-fish
constitute no inconsiderable part of the food of the
poor. In North America, they are principally caught
for their oil. If very large, the liver will yield a barrel
of oil, or about thirty gallons. In Nova Scotia, the
dried bodies are sold at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the hundred, for feeding
pigs. During the winter, from November till May,
two fish, boiled or roasted, are given per day to a good
sized store pig.</p>

<p>In 1842, in consequence of the great havoc committed
by the swarms of sharks on the fishing banks on
the coast of Finmark, eight vessels were fitted out at
Hammerfest, expressly for the purpose of shark fishing,
and no less than 20,000 of these rapacious fish were
taken, without any apparent diminution in their numbers.
The shark oil obtained from them was about
1,000 barrels.</p>

<p>There are shark fisheries on the eastern coast of
Africa, and in several parts of the Indian Ocean, for the
sake of the fins, which are exported to China. About
7,000 cwt. were imported into Canton, in 1850, chiefly
from India and the Eastern Archipelago. From 7,000
to 10,000 cwt. of sharks’ fins are shipped annually from
Bombay, and about 1,400 cwt. from the Madras territories,
to China. Sumatra, Manila, Malacca, Arracan, and
the Tenasserim Provinces, also send large quantities.</p>

<p>Dr. Buist, of Bombay, in a communication to the
Zoological Society, in 1851, stated, ‘that there are thirteen
large boats, with twelve men in each, constantly
employed in the shark fishery at Kurrachee; the value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
of the fins sent to market varying from 15,000 to 18,000
rupees (£1500 to £1800), or 1000 to 1200 rupees for
each boat, after allowing the Banian or factor his profit.
One boat will sometimes capture at a draught as many
as 100 sharks of different sizes. The average capture
of each boat probably amounts to about 3000, so as to
give the whole sharks captured at not less than 40,000
a year. The great basking shark, or mhor, is always
harpooned: it is found floating or asleep near the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>‘The fish, once struck, is allowed to run till tired; it
is then pulled in, and beaten with clubs till stunned. A
large hook is now hooked into its eyes or nostrils, or
wherever it can be got most easily attached, and by this
the shark is towed on shore; several boats are requisite
for towing. The mhor is often 40, sometimes 60, feet
in length; the mouth is occasionally 4 feet wide. All
other varieties of shark are caught in nets, in somewhat
like the way in which herrings are caught at home.
The net is made of strong English whip-cord; the
meshes about 6 inches; they are generally 6 feet wide,
and from 600 to 800 fathoms, or from three-quarters to
nearly a mile, in length. On the one side are floats of
wood about 4 feet in length, at intervals of 6 feet; on
the other, pieces of stone. The nets are sunk in deep
water, from 80 to 150 feet, well out at sea.</p>

<p>‘They are put in one day and taken out the next; so
that they are down two or three times a week, according
to the state of the weather, and success of the
fishing. The lesser sharks are commonly found dead,
the larger ones much exhausted. On being taken
home, the back fins, the only ones used, are cut off, and
dried on the sands in the sun: the flesh is cut off in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
long strips, and salted for food; the liver is taken out
and boiled down for oil; the head, bones, and intestines
left on the shore to rot, or thrown into the sea, where
numberless little sharks are generally on the watch to
eat up the remains of their kindred. The fishermen
themselves are only concerned in the capture of the
sharks. So soon as they are landed they are purchased
up by Banians, on whose account all the other operations
are performed. The Banians collect them in
quantities, and transmit them to agents in Bombay, by
whom they are sold for shipment to China.’</p>

<p>At the Bonin Islands, the colonists have trained their
dogs to catch fish; and Dr. Ruschenburger, who visited
the islands in the United States’ ship <i>Peacock</i>, tells us,
‘that two of these dogs would plunge into the water
and seize a shark, one on each side, by the fin, and
bring it ashore in spite of resistance.’</p>

<p>Blumenbach states, ‘that the white shark weighs
sometimes as much as 10,000 lbs.; and even a whole
horse has been found in its stomach.’ I may cite a few
statements which have come under my notice in the
course of newspaper reading:—</p>

<p>The <i>New Orleans Picayune</i> tells the following:—‘We
have read many fish stories, and they are generally
of that tenour that the very name inclines one to
disbelieve them. We have one to tell now, and, as we
know the person who was the main actor in the incident,
we can vouch for its being true, particularly as
there is ocular evidence of the matter. Some days
ago, the captain of a ship at anchor outside the Pass,
threw overboard a shark hook baited, not expecting in the
least, as the captain himself says, to catch anything of
the fish tribe. There was hooked, however, a shark of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
the spotted kind, and, as it afterwards proved, a
regular ‘man-eater.’ He had to be harpooned before
his capture could be effected. His size and weight may
be imagined from the fact, that it took 11 men to hoist
him in, with a double lift on the main yard. The
monster measured 17 feet 11 inches in length, from
tail to snout, and 9 feet in circumference. He had
seven rows of teeth, three of the rows being almost
hidden in the upper gums. His liver exactly filled up
a beef barrel. In his paunch was found the body of a
man in a half decomposed state. So far as could be
judged, the corpse was that of a well-dressed man, of
medium-size—shirt white, with pearl buttons, coarse
silk under-shirt, cotton socks, and shoes nearly new,
of the Congress gaiter kind. The shark had also in
his stomach several pieces of old canvas, such as are
used by vessels on their rigging. The jawbone of this
sea pirate has been brought up to the city. It is large
enough to take in a sugar barrel.’</p>

<p>A shark was caught a year or two ago, by the boats
of one of the East-end whaling establishments at Bermuda,
which measured 18 feet in length. Its liver
yielded 72 gallons of oil. The jaws, when detached
from the body and extended to their full width, afforded
space sufficient for three persons—the tallest at least 5
feet 10 inches—to stand erect within them. It had two-and-a-half
rows of teeth.</p>

<p>The basking shark, or sun-fish (<i>Squalus maximus</i>), is
the largest of the genus. The average size is about
25 feet long, by 18 in circumference, in the largest
part. It often lies on the surface of the water, apparently
sunning itself, and very frequently may be seen
steadily swimming with its dorsal fin above the water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
This species is viviparous, and possesses nothing of the
fierceness and voracity so peculiar to the shark family.</p>

<p>A large one, caught not long ago in the Mersey
river, Van Diemen’s Land, 14 feet long, upon hoisting
it upon deck, gave birth to 23 young ones, each about
18 inches long.</p>

<p>‘Some 25 years since, the capture of this valuable
fish was prosecuted very successfully from Innis Boffin
and the vicinity of Westport, at which town, as well as
Newport, there were works erected for trying out the
oil. About that date, as much as five pipes of oil of
120 gallons were received by one Dublin house alone
per season. It has much decreased of late years, which
is attributable rather to the decline of the means of
pursuit than to the absence of the fish, as it is seen
every year in large numbers on the distant banks, and
occasionally close to the shore in packs of 25 or 30,
in very fine weather. There were four taken at Galway
this year, and many were seen in the vicinity of
the Arran Islands. The liver has hitherto been considered
the only valuable part, averaging 30 cwts.,
and containing about 180 gallons of fine oil, second
only to sperm, and selling from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> per gallon.
The carcase, which may be estimated at from four to
five tons, is of a gelatinous character, consequently of
great value; <i>it is now thrown away as useless</i>. Neither
skill nor courage is required in the capture; it being of
a sluggish nature, and literally presenting its most
vulnerable part to the harpoon.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, writing
from Stone Bridge House, Tiverton, Rhode Island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
says:—‘A party of ladies and gentlemen, on the evening
of the 4th, caught and hauled about 20 of these
monsters (sharks) upon the bridge, measuring from 3
to 5 feet. The sport is generally continued from
twelve until nine o’clock in the evening, and as each
new-comer is laid at his scaly length up the stone
causeway, the ‘head-ache stick,’ as Uncle Ned quaintly
calls it, is applied to his hard sconce, until all propensity
for biting off swimmers’ legs has disappeared.
One Deacon Smith caught, on the same evening, an
enormous shark, which on being beached, measured over
7 feet across the fins. But the crowning sport was
reserved for the next day, when Mr. R. W. Potter, of
Pawtucket, went off with a party, among whom were
several ladies, and fastened to a huge shark, of the
mackerel species. The monster, on taking the bait and
finding himself hooked, went off with the line, like a
harpooned whale, despite all efforts to hold him. Having
a small tow-boat at hand, Mr. P. took to that, and paid
out, the shark towing him rapidly a long distance into
the bay, when, getting tired, returned, and came toward
the little boat with expanded jaws, and made desperate
fight to extricate himself, snapping at the line to bite it
off, and then throwing up his tail, would again shoot
off rapidly, carrying the boat after him, spinning
through the water. Hauling him cautiously back,
however, he was at last mastered by repeated vigorous
blows with the end of the oar, which was finally
run down the rascal’s throat, in which condition he
was towed ashore. It required the united strength of
six men, with a stout rope, to haul the creature upon
the beach, and he measured, from the tip of his nose,
over the fin, to the end of his tail, 3 feet 9 inches.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>A shark, 28 feet long, and measuring 18 feet round
the body, was caught in a weir, by John Horan, at
Rice’s Island, between Eastport and Lubec. His liver,
it is said, filled three barrels, and yielded a large
quantity of valuable oil.</p>

<p>The <i>Rangoon Chronicle</i> of 3rd March, 1854, reported
the capture of a shark of enormous size. The
animal, it seems, got stranded on the shoal or bar at
Yangeensiah, from which it could not extricate itself.
About 40 boatmen plunged into the water with dahs
and spears, and commenced a furious attack on the
monster, who inflicted very serious wounds on six of
the party, stripping the flesh entirely from the thigh of
one and leaving the bone bare. After a hard fight, the
shark fell a victim, dyeing the water with his blood.
The creature measured 35 feet, and afforded by very imperfect
cutting 365 lbs. of solid flesh, which the men
dried and brought to Rangoon for food.</p>

<p>The Barotse of Central Africa eat alligators. The
meat has a strong, musky odour, not at all inviting for
any one except the very hungry. After crossing the
Kasai, Livingstone saw that he was in a land where no
hope could be entertained of getting supplies of animal
food, for one of the guides caught a light blue coloured
mole and two mice for his supper. The care with
which he wrapped them up in a leaf and slung them on
his spear, told the Doctor that he would have but little
chance of enjoying larger game. At Cabango, in
Western Londa, a large amount of beer and beef was
consumed at a funeral; yet when the leg of a cow was
offered to Bango, a Londa chief, he said that neither he
nor his people ever partook of beef, as they looked
upon cattle as human, and living at home like men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
There are several other tribes who refuse to keep
cattle, though not to eat them when offered by others,
‘Because,’ say they, ‘oxen bring enemies and war;’
but this is the first instance met with by Livingstone in
which they have been refused as food. The fact of
these people killing pallahs for food shows that their
objection does not extend to meat in general. Near
the Tanba, (W. Londa,) Dr. Livingstone saw some
women carefully tending little lap dogs, which were to be
eaten. The Mambari, while in the Borotse valley, showed
their habits in their own country, (S.E. of Angola,)
digging up and eating, even there, where large game
abounds, the mice and moles which infest the country.</p>

<p>The flesh of the sturgeon has been esteemed in all
ages; but modern nations do not consider it so great a
luxury as the ancients; and, although deemed a royal
fish, it often hangs on hand in Billingsgate market, and
is retailed at a low price by the pound. This fish was
in high repute among the Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p>The flesh is white, delicate, and firm, and when
roasted resembles veal; it is generally eaten pickled,
and what we receive in that form comes from the Russian
rivers or from North America. There are several
varieties of sturgeon, the flesh of most of which is nutritious,
wholesome, and of an agreeable flavour. The
fat may be used as a substitute for butter or oil.</p>

<p>The flesh of the sharp-nosed sturgeon of North
America (<i>Acipenser oxyrinchus</i>) is like coarse beef,
quite firm and compact, but very rank and unsavoury.
The Indians of New Brunswick cut it up in large
pieces and salt it for winter use. It is only eaten by
those who can obtain no better fare. The flesh of a
young fish is much more delicate than that of an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
one; when stewed with rich gravy, its flavour is not
unlike that of veal.</p>

<p>Mr. Wingrove Cooke, in his account of a select
Chinese dinner, says:—‘The next dish was sturgeon
skull-cap—rare and gelatinous, but I think not so peculiar
in its flavour as to excuse the death of several royal fish.
This fish, being taken from its brazen, lamp-heated stand,
was succeeded by a stew of shark fins and pork. The
shark fins were boiled to so soft a consistency that they
might have been turbot fins. The Chinaman must have
smiled at the unreasonable prejudices of the occidentals
when he saw some of us tasting the pork but fighting
shy of the shark. He probably, however, did not know
that the same occidentals would eat with relish of a fish
which they themselves enticed to their angle by a worm
or a maggot. Next in order came a soup composed of
balls of crab. I have tasted this better prepared at
Macao. It assumes there the form of a very capital
salad, made of crab and cooked vegetables.’</p>

<p>The fondness of the Chinese for all gelatinous substances
is well known, and has been described by all
those who have visited that country and partaken of
their banquets. In addition to employing animals and
parts of animals which are rejected in other countries,
as articles of diet, they import various substances which
can be valuable only as yielding gelatine of different
degrees of purity; of these we have examples in tripang,
birdsnests, sharks’ fins, fish maws, and agar-agar,
a fucus.</p>

<p>The fresh water lamprey (<i>Petromyzon fluviatilis</i>)
was formerly of great importance as a delicacy, and also
largely used as bait by fishermen. In Germany another
species (<i>P. Planeri</i>) are taken in large quantities, fried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
packed in barrels by layers, with bay leaves and spices,
sprinkled with vinegar, and thus exported to other
countries.</p>

<p>The sea lamprey (<i>P. marinus</i>) is held in high estimation
by epicures in the United States and elsewhere,
but is not eaten in the British American Provinces. It is
a formidable enemy to the royal sturgeon, fastening upon
its belly and eating into the flesh; and not unfrequently
a sturgeon has leaped into a canoe, in its efforts to disengage
itself from several of these troublesome parasites.</p>

<p>Lampreys, well known to have given a fatal surfeit to
Henry I., when made into pies, were anciently esteemed
a ‘pretty present.’</p>

<p>Eels appear to have been early favourites, particularly
in the monasteries. The cellaress of Barking
Abbey, Essex, in the ancient times of that foundation,
was amongst other eatables ‘to provide russ aulx in
Lenton, and to bake with <i>elys</i> on Shere Tuesday:’ and
at Shrovetide she was to have ready ‘twelve <i>stubbe eles</i>
and nine <i>schaft eles</i>.’ The regulation and management
for the sale of eels seems to have formed a prominent
feature in the old ordinances of the Fishmongers’
Company. There were artificial receptacles made for
eels in our rivers, called <i>Anguilonea</i>, constructed with
rows of poles that they might be more easily taken.
The cruel custom of salting eels alive is mentioned
by some old writers.</p>

<p>The flesh of the eel (<i>Anguilla vulgaris</i>), being highly
nutritious, is excellent as food, but is sometimes found
too oily for weak stomachs.</p>

<p>Eel pies and stewed eels cause a large demand in this
metropolis, and some 70 or 80 cargoes, or about 700
tons a year, are brought over from Holland. The total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
consumption of this fish in England is estimated at
4,300 tons per annum. Eels are very prolific. They
are found in almost all parts of the world.</p>

<p>An abundance of large eels of fine quality are caught
in the rivers and harbours of New Brunswick.</p>

<p>If a market should be found for this description of
fish from North America, they could be furnished to an
unlimited extent. My friend and correspondent, Mr.
Perley, says, ‘In the calm and dark nights during
August and September, the largest eels are taken in
great numbers by the Micmac Indians and Acadian
French, in the estuaries and lagoons, by torch-light, with
the Indian spear. This mode of taking eels requires
great quickness and dexterity, and a sharp eye. It is
pursued with much spirit, as, besides the value of the
eel, the mode of fishing is very exciting.</p>

<p>‘In winter, eels bury themselves in the muddy parts of
rivers, and their haunts, which are generally well known,
are called eel grounds. The mud is thoroughly probed
with a five pronged iron spear, affixed to a long handle,
and used through a hole in the ice. When the eels are
all taken out of that part within reach of the spear, a
fresh hole is cut, and the fishing goes on again upon new
ground.’</p>

<p>It was by a mistake that the Jews abstained from eating
eels. The prohibition is as follows:—‘All that
have not fins and scales, &amp;c., ye shall have in abomination.’—Lev.
xi., 10, 11. The <i>Siluridæ</i>, which have
no scales, were held in abomination by the Egyptians.
In describing one of them (the Schall) which he had
found in the Nile, M. Sonnini, says—‘A fish without
scales, with soft flesh, and living at the bottom of a
muddy river, could not have been admitted into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
dietetic system of the ancient Egyptians, whose priests
were so scrupulously rigid in proscribing every aliment
of unwholesome quality. Accordingly, all the different
species of <i>Siluri</i> found in the Nile were forbidden.’
This then was probably one of the forbidden kinds,
and this fact supports the opinion before ventured as to
the origin of the custom. The rest of the prohibition
was probably levelled against aquatic reptiles, which
were generally looked upon as possessing poisonous
qualities.</p>

<p>It has been well observed by a recent popular writer,
that any Cockney, with two shillings and sixpence in
his pocket, may regale himself at Billingsgate, at
Blackwall, or Richmond, on delicacies to which the
senate and people of Rome were utter strangers.
Indeed, it is no inconsiderable set off against the
disadvantages of living so far from the sun, that the
supplies of northern fish markets are incontestably and
greatly superior to those of any Italian or Sicilian
pascheria: superior, 1st, because in those kinds which
are common to our great ocean, and their ‘great sea,’
our own are better flavoured; because, 2ndly, even the
finer sorts, which belong exclusively to the Mediterranean,
are for the most part poor; and 3rdly, and
above all, because there is an almost total want in its
waters of species which we consider, and advisedly, as
our best. Were superiority to be determined by mere
beauty and variety of colouring, the market of Billingsgate
could not enter into competition for a moment with
the smallest fishing town in the south, where the fish
are for the most part coasters, and derive their gorgeous
hues from the same buccina and coquillage whence the
Tyrians got their superb dyes. But as the gayest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
plumage is by no means indicative of the bird best
adapted for the table, so brilliancy of scales affords no
criterion by which to judge of the culinary excellence
of fish, the beauty of whose skin, in this instance, contrasts
singularly with the quality of the fish, which is
generally poor and insipid, and sometimes unwholesome
and even deleterious. The Mediterranean pelagians
(or open sea-fish) have neither brilliancy of colour nor
delicacy of flesh to atone for the want of it; so that no
Englishman will repine to leave tunny beef to the
Sicilian ichthyophagist, whilst he has the genuine pasture-fed
article at home in place of it. Nor though, to
such coarse feeders as the ancient Greeks, sword-fish
might be held equal to veal, will his better instructed
palate assent to such a libel upon wholesome butcher’s
meat. Mullet must indeed be admitted on all hands
to be good fish; but one good thing only in a hundred
does not satisfy omnivorous man, and <i>toujours Triglia</i>
is not better than <i>toujours Perdrix</i>, as every one who
has passed a winter at Naples knows to his cost.
Sardines are only palatable in oil; <i>au naturel</i> they are
exceedingly poor and dry: and for that other small
clupean, the anchovy (the latent virtues of which are
only elicited by the process which metamorphoses the
fish into sauce), British whitebait is far more than an
equivalent.—But if the Mediterranean has but few
<i>alumni</i> to be proud of, the poverty of its waters is
certainly more conspicuous in its deficiencies than in its
supplies; indeed, the instinct of all first-rate fish seems
to be to turn their tails upon this sea. Thus among the
Salmonidæ, salmon and smelt are alike unknown; of the
Gadian family, all the finest species, as cod, haddock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
whiting, ling, and coal fish are wanting; and to quote
but one other example—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>as we read in the Apocrypha of Dr. Darwin, not one
ever entered the Bay of Naples, unless salted in a
barrel from England.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Finnon, Buckie, and Bervie smoked haddock
is largely vended in London and other large towns,
being esteemed an excellent relish. They are split,
cleaned, and steeped in strong pickle about three hours,
and then smoked for fifteen or sixteen hours. After
a kiln full is smoked and cooled, the fish are packed in
dry barrels the same as pickled mackerel, excepting
that every two tiers are packed face to face, so that the
back of one fish does not come in contact with the split
side of another fish. The increase in the timber trade
of late years, and the establishment of saw-mills, have
rendered sawdust abundant, and the Scotch fisherwives
have made the discovery that haddocks can be
smoked with sawdust to look nearly as well as when
smoked with peat; while they have not the wisdom to
anticipate the loss of custom which must unavoidably
ensue as soon as the deficiency of flavour is discovered.</p>

<p>Fresh herrings come in in enormous quantities to our
metropolitan markets, and, from the consumption of
several millions of them, must be esteemed a dainty by
some. Pickled or cured herrings,—of which 580,814
barrels were salted in 1857, at the British Fisheries,—are
chiefly consumed abroad; the shipments to the
Continent last year having been 219,000 barrels, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
58,534 barrels went to Ireland. In 1855, out of a cure
of 766,703 barrels, the Continental export reached
344,029 barrels. Last year (1857), 128,600 barrels
went to Stettin.</p>

<p>Scotch herrings go to Russia quite as much as St.
Petersburgh tallow comes to London, 60,000 or 70,000
barrels passing the Sound, or going <i>via</i> Konigsberg and
Dantzic. One great inducement to the Russian population
to purchase the herrings is, it is said, the quantity
of undissolved salt the barrels are found to contain.</p>

<p>It is in the form of red-herrings and bloaters that the
largest consumption of this fish takes place in the
metropolis. The sale of bloaters at Billingsgate is
about 265,000 baskets of 160 each annually, and about
50,000,000 of red-herrings.</p>

<p>There was a pleasant tradition current in Yarmouth
not many years since, that the ‘red’ herring was the
result of accident. According to the story, a fisherman
had hung up some salted herrings in his hut and forgotten
them. They hung where they were exposed to
the smoke from the wood fire of the hut; and, some
days afterwards, his attention was attracted to them,
when, being struck by their appearance, he determined to
see how one of them tasted. The result was so satisfactory
that he hastened to King John, who was then
lying near Norwich, to make a present of the remainder;
when the herrings were esteemed such a delicacy by the
monarch that he then and there expressed his determination
to grant a charter of incorporation to the town
from which they were brought. The only certain
portion of this story is, that the first charter of Yarmouth
was granted by King John.</p>

<p>There is a curious item in this town charter of Yarmouth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
long famous for its herring fair. The burgesses
are obliged to send to the sheriffs of Norwich 100 herrings,
to be made into 24 pies; and these pies are to
be delivered to the Lord of the manor of East Carleton,
who is to convey them to the king.</p>

<p>The receipt for making herring pie would be a
curious, though perhaps not a valuable, addition to our
modern cookery books. It is probably lost, unless Her
Majesty continues to receive these once prized patties.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The stromming, or herring of the North seas, is only
about the size of a sprat, but a much more delicate
fish; when salted and mixed with potatoes it is the
staple food of the people, being washed down with a
bowl of milk, or a glass of corn-brandy.</p>

<p>The conger is found in the seas of Europe, of
Northern Asia, and in those of America, as far as the
Antilles. It is very abundant on the coasts of England
and France, in the Mediterranean Sea, where it was
much sought after by the ancients, and in the Propontis,
where it was not long ago in considerable
estimation. Those of Sicyon were more especially
esteemed. The flesh of this fish is white and well
flavoured; but as it is very fat, it does not agree with
all stomachs. In many places the conger eels are dried
for exportation. For this purpose, they are cut open in
their under part, through their entire length, the intestines
are removed, deep scarifications are made upon
the back, the parts are kept separate by means of
small sticks, and they are suspended by the tail to
poles, on the branches of trees. When they are perfectly
dry, they are collected in packets, each weighing
about 200 lbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>The voracious conger eel (<i>Conger vulgaris</i>, of Cuvier;
the <i>Muræna conger</i>, of Linnæus,) although a coarse
fish, forms a considerable article of commerce in Cornwall
and Devonshire. I only notice it here from the
fact, that it is sometimes dried and shipped to Spain
and other Catholic countries, where fish of any kind is
acceptable. When dried in a particular manner, the
flesh used formerly to be ground or grated to powder,
and in this state was employed to thicken soup.</p>

<p>The <i>Murænæ conger</i>, were carefully reared in vivaria
by the Romans. As early as the time of Cæsar, the multiplication
of the domestic <i>Murænæ</i> was so great, that on
the occasion of one of his triumphs, that great general
presented 6000 of them to his friends; Licinius Crassus
reared them so as to be obedient to his voice, and to
come and receive their food from his hands; while the
celebrated orator, Quintus Hortensius, wept over the
loss of those of which death had deprived him.</p>

<p>Such is the testimony to the quality and estimation
of the conger eel, which Griffiths has collected in
his <i>Supplement to Malacopterygii apodes in Cuvier’s
Animal Kingdom</i>. Its flesh does not agree with all
stomachs; but it is yet a matter of dispute what renders
it so frequently deadly. The condition of the
liver of the fish in most cases has a great deal to do
with danger attending fish-poisons.</p>

<p>The sand eel (<i>Ammodytes tobianus</i>) and the sandlaunce
(<i>A. lancea</i>), though of small size, are very delicate
eating, and vast numbers are consumed in summer
by the natives of the Hebrides. They are also much
sought after by the fishermen for bait.</p>

<p>The smelt or spirling (<i>Osmerus eperlanus</i>), found
abundantly on the British coasts, is a very delicate fish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
It is generally taken in greatest plenty at the mouths
of large rivers, or in estuaries, such as the Thames and
Medway, from August to May, as well as on sandy
shores, in small nets; and always commands a ready
sale. It has a peculiar odour, whence its popular
name, which has been compared to that of a cucumber
or a violet. This is strongest when the fish is first
taken, but it may be perceived by raising the gill
covers, after the fish has been for some time out of the
water.</p>

<p>A whitebait dinner, at Blackwall or Greenwich, is one
of the epicurean celebrities of the metropolis; and the fishing
for whitebait, which commences about the beginning
of April, and becomes abundant during the summer
months till September, is productive of considerable
benefit to those concerned. It was long supposed that
these were the fry of a larger fish, but they are now
identified as a particular species (<i>Clupea alba</i>), so
named from the sides of the fish being uniformly of a
white colour. It attains to the length of 6 inches.
The whitebait are taken in long bag-nets, from vessels
moored in the tide-way; and the fish are taken out by
untying the end of the hose, and shaking it into the boat.</p>

<p>But there are small and delicate fish, which are substitutes
for whitebait, in other quarters of the world.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. T. Atwood (<i>History of Dominica</i>) tells
us, ‘that the chief dainty among the fresh-water fish of
that island is the young frey, with which the rivers
there are filled twice or thrice every year, and which
are called by the French ‘Tréz-tréz.’ These consist
of various kinds of sea-fish just spawned, and with
which that element swarms for some miles distance from
the shore, in numbers truly astonishing. These little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
creatures come into the rivers like a living stream,
and in a short time swim two or three miles, to an
amazing height up the country. This they perform in
a wonderful manner, skimming over such rapid streams
as repel their weak endeavours, from rock to rock, the
surfaces of which are covered with them; or seeking
the smoothly gliding stream at the sides of the banks,
by degrees ascend the highest parts of the rivers.</p>

<p>‘The first day of the appearance of these frey in the
rivers, they are transparent and clear as crystal, so that
every bone in them may be counted, and the movement
of their vitals can be plainly discerned. The second day
after they lose much of that transparency; and the third
or fourth day, it is wholly lost by the nutriment which
they feed on. They are caught in baskets, in which is
put a tablecloth or sheet, and sinking the basket with
stones, vast quantities are taken at a time. They
are fried in a batter made of flour and milk, or stewed
with herbs and spices, and are excellent food cooked
either way.’</p>

<p>At Moutrah, a town situated in a deep bay, not far
from Muscat, they dry and export large quantities of a
diminutive fish, about two inches long, which are packed
in bales. This species of fish literally fills the waters
of Oman. Dr. Ruschenberger (<i>Voyage Round the
World</i>, p. 121) says, ‘They sometimes appeared in
dense strata about the ship, so as completely to hide the
cable from view, which was distinctly seen when they
were not present.’</p>

<p>Don Pernety, in his <i>Journal of a Voyage to the
Falkland Islands</i>, speaks of a small fish, called by the
Spaniards pajes, and by the French <i>gras dos</i>, which
was almost transparent, and of a most exquisite delicacy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
It was found excellent when fried, and not inferior
to the eel pout.</p>

<p>There is a small fish resembling a shrimp, not half-an-inch
long, which makes its annual appearance in some
of the rivers of Peru, in February, or in the beginning
of March. It is called <i>chantisa</i>, and is really a great
delicacy, when prepared by the natives. The numbers
which ascend the rivers are so great, that on each side
they appear to form a white path in the water, about
two feet broad, and several miles in length. The
women employ themselves in taking them, for which
purpose they have a canoe; two of them hold a piece
of flannel, three yards long, by the corners, and place
it under the surface of the water, one end being a little
elevated, to prevent the chantisa from passing; and
when a considerable quantity are collected, the flannel is
taken up and emptied into the canoe, after which the
operation is repeated. Mr. Stephenson (<i>Travels in
America</i>) says, he has frequently seen in the course
of two hours, from six to eight bushels taken in this
manner by these women. They are preserved by using
as much salt as is necessary to season them; they are
then put into baskets, lined with leaves, and a large stone
is placed on the top, to press them into a solid mass,
like a cheese. After standing a day or two, the baskets
are placed on a frame made of canes, which is elevated
about a yard from the ground; they are then covered
with plantain leaves, and a small fire of green cedar,
sandal, or other aromatic wood, is kindled underneath,
for the purpose of smoking them. After remaining 10
or 12 hours, the cakes are taken out of the baskets,
and again exposed to the smoke till it has penetrated
through them, when they are laid up for use. A small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
portion of the smoked chantisa is generally added to
the fish while cooking, to which it communicates a very
delicate flavour.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the river Columbia, a very small
fish, about the size of the sardine, is caught in immense
numbers by the Chinooks. It is called by them <i>uhlekun</i>,
and is much prized on account of its delicacy and extraordinary
fatness. When dried, this fish will burn
from one end to the other with a clear, steady light,
like a candle. The uhlekuns are caught with astonishing
rapidity by means of an instrument about seven
feet long; the handle is about three feet, into which is
fixed a curved wooden blade, about four feet, something
the shape of a sabre, with the edge at the back. In
this edge, at the distance of an inch and a half, are
inserted sharp bone teeth, about an inch long. The
Indian, standing in the canoe, draws this edgeways with
both hands, holding it like a paddle, rapidly through the
dense shoals of fish, which are so thick, that almost
every tooth will strike a fish. One knock across the
thwarts sharply deposits them in the bottom of the
canoe. This is done with such rapidity, that they will
not use nets for this description of fishing.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The anchovy (<i>Engraulis encrasicolus</i>, Cuvier) is a
small fish, much resembling the sprat, which is often
sold for it, but may be readily distinguished from the
sprat by the anal fin being remarkably short. It is
common on the southern coasts of France and Spain, on
the shores of Italy, Greece, and other parts of the Mediterranean,
but those coming from Gorgona (an island
in the gulf of Leghorn) are esteemed the best. Anchovies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
should be chosen small, fresh pickled, silver
white on the outside, and red within. They must have
a round back, for those which are flat or large, dark
outside, with pale coloured flesh, and tapering much
towards the tail, are often nothing but sardines. First
quality anchovies are used as a condiment, and among
epicures are esteemed a luxury. The trade in them
with the Italian States is very considerable; about
150,000 lbs. being annually exported. The fishing is
chiefly in the night time, when a light being placed on
the stern, the anchovies flock around, and are caught
in the nets. Mr. Couch, in his <i>Cornish Fauna</i>, says,
that he has seen it about the Cornish coast, of the
length of seven inches and a half, which is nearly
double the length it is met with in the Mediterranean.
It abounds, he adds, towards the end of summer, and
if attention were paid to the fishing, enough might be
caught to supply the consumption of the British islands.</p>

<p>Frezier (<i>Voyage to the South Seas</i>) speaks of seeing
a sort of anchovy on the west coast of America, in such
great numbers, that whole baskets full of them were
readily taken on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The anchovy and tunny fisheries of Dalmatia are
important, though not so much so as during the last
century; at present they furnish employment to about
8,000 men.</p>

<p>Anchovies are imported in small kegs, weighing about
12 lbs. each. The consumption varies here, from 50 to
100 tons a year.</p>

<p>Sheridan used to relate an amusing story of an Irish
officer, who once belonged to a regiment in Malta, who
returned to England on leave of absence, and, according
to the custom of travellers, was fond of relating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
wonders he had seen. Among other things, he one day,
in a public coffee-room, expatiated on the excellence of
living in general among the military at Malta. But,
said he, ‘as for anchovies, by the powers, there is nothing
to be seen like them in the known world;’ and he
added, ‘I have seen the anchovies grow upon the trees
with my own eyes many’s the hundred times, and beautiful
is the grove of them the governor has in his garden
on the esplanade.’ A gentleman present disputed the
statement that anchovies grew on trees, which the
Irishman with much warmth re-affirmed. The lie
passed, a challenge was given, and the upshot of the
matter is thus humorously related.</p>

<p>‘The Englishman gave his address, and the next
day the parties met, attended by their seconds; they
fired, and O’Flanagan’s shot took effect in the fleshy
part of his opponent’s thigh, which made the latter
jump a foot from the ground, and fall flat upon his
back, where he lay a few seconds in agony, kicking
his heels. This being observed by the Irishman’s second,
he said:—‘You have hit your man, O’Flanagan, that
is certain, I think not dangerously, however, for see
what capers he cuts.’</p>

<p>‘‘Capers, capers!’ exclaimed the Irishman. ‘Oh!
by the powers, what have I done? What have I done?
What a dreadful mistake!’ and running up to his
wounded antagonist, he took his hand, and pressing it
eagerly, thus addressed him:—‘My dear friend, if
you’re kilt, I ax your pardon in this world and in the
next, for I made a devil of a mistake: and it was
capers that I saw growing upon the trees at Malta, and
no anchovies at all.’</p>

<p>‘The wounded man, smiling at his ludicrous explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
and apology, said,—‘My good fellow, I wish you
had thought of that a little sooner; I don’t think you
have quite killed me, but I hope you will remember
the difference between anchovies and capers as long as
you live.’’</p>

<p>That highly esteemed fish, the sardine (<i>Clupea
sardina</i>), which is closely allied to the pilchard, though
much smaller, is found chiefly in the Mediterranean. It
is taken in considerable quantities on our shores, and
is exceedingly plentiful on the coast of Algarva, in
Portugal, Andalusia and Granada in Spain, and
along the shores of Italy. The small sardines, caught
on the coast of Provence, in France, are esteemed the
best. The French frequently cure them in red brine,
and when thus prepared, designate them anchovied
sardines. Sardines constitute a considerable portion
of the food of the lower orders in Lisbon. 6,269 cases of
sardines were imported into San Francisco, in 1853.</p>

<p>In 1852, 576 millions of sardines were taken on the
coast of Brittany, which extends about 200 miles. Half
of these were sold fresh and the other half preserved
in oil. 160 vessels manned by 3,500 sailors and fishermen
are engaged in the trade. The preparation, transport,
and sale of the fish employ 10,000 persons. 9,000
of these, of whom one half are females, are occupied all
the winter in making and mending of nets. On shore, the
preparation, conveyance, and sale of the fish give occupation
to 4,500 persons, of whom 2,500 are women; and
in the interior of the country 4,400 other persons are
occupied in the sale.</p>

<p>The fishing lasts about 200 days, and yields a net
profit to all concerned of three millions of francs. The
sardines disappear in November and return in April.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Where they go during these four months, why they go,
or what they do while gone, has never yet been discovered.
The fishermen say that the same individuals
never come twice, that every successive arrival is composed
of fish of smaller size than those that left last, and
that they appear to be their young. At any rate, they
count implicitly on their appearance, and no sardine was
ever yet known to break an engagement thus tacitly
entered into.</p>

<p>A very intelligent naturalist and correspondent of
mine, Mr. R. Hill, has furnished me with some interesting
information respecting the West Indian fishes. One
of the best labroid fishes is the hog fish, both for its
flesh, thick, white, and luscious, separating in large
strata, and its exemption from small abdominal bones.
It is one of the commonest and yet one of the best fishes
taken in the harbour of Port Royal, either by the fish
pot or the line, the only source for supplying the Kingston
market in the deep waters there.</p>

<p>The hog fish has its scales red with yellow at the
base of each. It feeds amongst rocks, attains 3 and
4 feet of length, though 2½ feet is usually the
largest dimension in Jamaica. The flesh is most
delicious, but its fullness and firmness make it good for
drying and smoking, when too large for a one day’s
dish.</p>

<p>There are several <i>Lachnolaimes</i> ordinarily in the
market, but only one properly called the hog fish (<i>Suillus</i>).
The villous membrane that covers part of the
pharyngeals and palate gives it its scientific name,
‘woolly throat.’</p>

<p>The most beautiful is the <i>aigula</i>, the aigrette of the
Windward Islands. They are all sought after for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
excellence of their flesh, ‘<i>la bonté de leur chair</i>,’ but
one, the <i>caninus</i>, is occasionally poisonous.</p>

<p>The yellow tail snapper (<i>Mesoprion cynodon</i>) and
other species of the genus, attain a large size, and are
much esteemed in the East and West Indies as an
article of food.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Queen mullet (<i>Upeneus martinicus</i>) of
the Indian and American seas is very delicious, and resembles
in some respects the true mullet (<i>Mullus surmuletus</i>).</p>

<p>The paracuta (<i>Sphyræna Barracuda</i>), the pike
of the ocean, has a firm and palatable flesh, and is
esteemed by many people. It proves, however, sometimes
poisonous when caught in certain localities.</p>

<p>The callipeva (<i>Mugil liza</i>) is an esteemed river fish
of the West Indian seas, which seldom extends further
than the embouchures of streams or into the ponds and
marshes. Chief Justice Temple, of Honduras, characterizes
it as the salmon of the tropics; and indeed, it
very much resembles that prince of the finny tribe in its
size, shape, habits, and flavour. The flesh, however, is
not red, neither is it so firm as that of the salmon, but
it is quite as fat and infinitely more juicy and delicate.
When cut in slices, folded in tissue paper, and lightly
fried—which is the only way in my opinion of dressing
a fish, the flavour of which is so volatile, so smooth, so
ethereal, that it more resembles an odour, or the rich
fragrance of a thousand different flowers mixed and
mellowed by distance, than an actual taste on the
palate—nothing can surpass it;—to subject it unprotected
to the fumiginous influence of an iron pan,
would be the act of a Hottentot or a Tartar. Dressed in
the manner I have mentioned, it would not have disgraced
Olympus, nor offended the critical taste of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Apicii, the last of whom would have refrained from
hanging himself whilst a single callipeva remained in
his fish pond. The callipeva is very excellent when
cured, and it is often brought in that state to the
Belize market in large quantities. The roe of this fish
is very superior and almost equals caviare. This is
dried and sold separately. I may incidentally mention
that the large strong brilliant scales of this fish now
enter into commerce for the manufacture of those pretty
fish-scale ornaments, brooches, bracelets, &amp;c., sold at
the Crystal Palace and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <i>Mugil curema</i>, another species, is taken about
Port Royal harbour, Jamaica, and when large, passed
off in the Kingston market for callipeva. The true callipeva
or calipever, as it is indifferently spelt, is the
‘white salmon’ of Jamaica, and weighs from 6 to 18 lbs.
It is caught in the brackish waters of the Ferry on the
road to Spanish Town.</p>

<p>Mullet of various kinds, the salt water species being
white, and the mountain or river species red, are one of
the three delicacies of Jamaica.</p>

<p>Then, there is the delicate smook, either fresh or
salt water, weighing from 10 to 16 lbs.; the stone bass,
of the river or sea, much esteemed, from 2 to 4 lbs.; the
delicate black snapper, weighing 4 or 5 lbs.; the chuck,
a delicate fresh-water fish, of about 6 lbs.; and the cutlass,
a good flat frying fish: which will suffice to show
that there need be no lack of a dish of good fish for the
West Indian epicure.</p>

<p>The anchovy or silver fish (<i>Engraulis edentatus</i> of
Cuvier and Val) abounds on the palisade shallows of
Port Royal harbour. They are a most exquisite fry,
cooked, strung together on a palm straw through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
eye by half-dozens, and served up as they serve whitebait.</p>

<p>King fish are only occasionally taken within the
harbour, at Port Royal Bank. They are very delicate
eating and weigh from 10 to 20 lbs. The king fish
mackerel (<i>Cymbium regale</i>) is taken at the head of the
harbour by being gently towed for with a line. The
pine fish, in great estimation with the Jews, which
ranges from four to thirty pounds, are frequently harpooned
from Port Royal dock yard, six feet long.</p>

<p>The sun fish, or lucannany of Demerara, is excellent
food, being firm, fat, and with few bones; owing to its
extreme lusciousness, it is difficult to salt or dry. It is
about two feet in length and attains to 7 or 8 lbs. in
weight.</p>

<p>The arawan is another Guiana fish, particularly fine
as food, but like the last named, very fat and luscious.</p>

<p>The pacou are caught in large numbers by means of
weirs or dams, and weigh on an average 7 lbs. each.
They are split, salted, and dried, and when cured,
highly prized. The morocoto, or osibu, is also a most
delicious fish, in taste nearer resembling flesh than fish,
and eagerly sought after by the epicure.</p>

<p>If the gourami, which the French have introduced to
the tanks and ponds of Cayenne and their West Indian
Islands, was entitled to no more than half the praise
Commerson bestows upon it, it must be considered a
fish worth some trouble and expense to possess. ‘Nihil
inter pisces,’ he says, ‘tum marinos, tum fluviatiles,
exquisitius unquam degustavi.’ If neither the fishes of
the sea nor those of fresh water streams, to Commerson,
who had described so many fishes, and tasted as many
as he had described, were found to exceed the deliciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
of the gourami,—the <i>Osphromenus olfax</i>,—it
should be imported into every West Indian colony.
The Dutch at Batavia, in Java, have long bred it in
large earthen vases, changing the water daily, and feeding
it on herbs of rivers and ponds, particularly on the
<i>Pistia natans</i>. In the Mauritius, they have become a
common river fish, and are esteemed the most delicate
of the dishes brought to table.</p>

<p>Capt. Philibut carried the specimens of the gourami
from Mauritius to Cayenne. Out of 100 taken on board
he lost 23 on the passage. The French colonists feed
and breed it in ponds, much as the Barbadians do the
caffum (<i>Megalops Atlanticus</i>). The caffum is allied to
the herring, and weighs 12 or 15 lbs.; and though an
important stand-by for a dinner in Barbados, it is an
inferior fish.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, I well remember that Mr. Richard
Hill called attention in Jamaica to the gourami,
which was first then being introduced as a tank
fish into Martinique and Guadaloupe. His communication
appeared in Dr. Paul’s <i>Physical Journal</i>,
published at Kingston.</p>

<p>It is supposed that this valuable fresh-water fish was
procured originally from China, but not a single author
gives intimation of it in the natural history of the
Chinese empire. So interesting a species, among people
so attentive to the breeding and cultivating whatever
can be added to their food supplies, must have been
brought under their notice. The Dutch have it only
artificially bred in Java, but neither Renard, Valentine,
Russell, nor Buchanan, who have all written
largely on the fishes of India and of the Indian Islands,
are acquainted with any such river-fish as the gourami.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
In India they give the name <i>gouragi</i> or <i>koragi</i> to a
fish known to naturalists as the <i>Ophicephalus</i>, and the
probability is that Commerson, who first noticed the
<i>Osphromenus olfax</i>, had corruptly applied that word
and made <i>gourami</i> of it.</p>

<p>This delicious fish, so easily bred and fed, from its
food being the duck weed of the ponds, has a contour
plump, round, and massy like the carp of Europe. The
colour is a burnished brown, somewhat golden tinted,
faintly ruddy, particularly on the head and fins. Vertical
bands of bronze stretch obliquely from the back to
the belly;—and the ventral fin in its first spine is
lengthened into a long thread as long as the entire fish
from head to tail. It belongs to a very curious family
distinguished as <i>labyrinthan-pharyngeals</i>. The structure
of fishes of this family is peculiar:—it consists
of the upper surface of the pharyngeal bones being
divided into leaves, which form cavities and ledges,
more or less complicated, for the retention of water, very
much like the web of cells in the paunch of the camel.
This apparatus lies immediately under the opercula.
It is closely shut in, and pours out a ceaseless stream to
moisten the gills and keep them from drying up when
the fish quits the water and betakes itself to the grass,
either to feed on herbs or to change its domicile when
the ponds grow muddy and stagnant.</p>

<p>The ancient writers on Natural History were familiar
with the character of these curious <i>pharyngeals</i>.
Theophrastus, in his Treatise, speaks of certain of the
fishes of India that come forth from the rivers at times,
and then return to them again: and he mentions
that they resemble mullets. The strange habit of the
<i>Anabas</i>, which has received this name from its climbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
predilections, (anabaino, ascendo,) is well authenticated.
M. Daldorf, a Lieutenant in the service of the Dutch
East India Company, in an article in the <i>Linnæan
Transactions for 1797</i>, mentions that, in the month of
November 1791, he took one of these anabas fishes from
the cleft foot-stalk of a palm tree, growing near a
pond. The fish was five feet above the water, and was
endeavouring to ascend still higher. Another observer,
M. John, tells a similar story. The fish, he says,
usually remains in the muddy bottom of ponds and
lakes; but it will take to creeping on dry ground for
several hours, by the inflexion of its body; and by the
assistance of its serrated opercula, and the spines of
its fins, it will climb on the palm-trees which are in
the neighbourhood of ponds, along which drops the
water that the rains have accumulated at their tops.—(Griffith’s
<i>Supplement to Cuvier’s Animal Kingdom</i>.
<i>Fishes</i>, p. 361.)</p>

<p>Though the gourami belongs to the family of fishes,
having a reservoir for water to moisten the gills when
they quit their ponds, it does not climb trees as the
anabas, but only traverses the grass. This fish would
be a most desirable acquisition to our colonies. It could
be readily procured from Guadaloupe. It is as remarkable
for its size as its flavour. It becomes as large
as a turbot, and is equally delicious. It would be soon
naturalized in our streams. The female hollows a little
fosse in the edge of the reservoir in which it is kept,
and there deposits its eggs.</p>

<p>The pirarucu (<i>Sudis gigas</i>) is a splendid fish 5 or
6 feet long, with large scales of more than an inch in
diameter, and beautifully marked and spotted with red.</p>

<p>The lakes in Brazil contain great quantities of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
and they are salted and dried for the Para market. It
is a very fine flavoured fish, the belly in particular
being so fat and rich that it cannot be cured, and is
therefore generally eaten fresh. ‘This fish’ (remarks
Mr. Wallace) ‘with farinha and some coffee made us
an excellent supper; and the alligator’s tails which
I now tasted for the first time, was by no means to be
despised. A smaller kind is that eaten, the flesh being
more delicate than in the larger species.’</p>

<p>The sheep’s head, or, in more scientific language, the
<i>Sargus ovis</i>, is a favourite fish in North America, where
it visits the coasts in large shoals during the summer
and autumn. The principal fishery is off the coasts of
New York, and thousands are occasionally taken at a
single cast of the large nets used at some places.
The fish, immediately on their capture, are packed in
ice, and sent to the New York market, where they have
been known to sell as high as £7 for one of large size,
although the usual price for one is only about a dollar.
This fish is pretty generally considered throughout the
States, both by epicures and others, as an almost <i>sans-pareil</i>;
and Dr. Mitchell, who has written much on
American ichthyology, is of the same opinion.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The green cavalla (<i>Caranx Bartholomæi</i>) is very
good eating, and much in demand. They are caught
by the Barbados fishermen, sometimes in nets and in
large numbers. Another species, the Jack ‘or John
and Goggle-eye,’ as it is locally termed (<i>C. Plumieri</i>),
is in some seasons of the year very poisonous. When
they are suspected of being so, an experiment is tried
upon a duck, by giving her one of them to swallow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
and if at that season it is poisonous, the duck dies
in about two hours.</p>

<p>The flounder or plaice (<i>Rhombus ocellatus</i>), a fish
which belongs to the turbots, is a very delicate fish.</p>

<p>The common flying-fish (<i>Exocœtus Roberti</i>) is so
abundant in some seasons of the year about Barbados,
that they constitute an important article of food, and
during the season, a large number of small boats are
occupied in fishing. They are very delicate and tender.
Some experiments have been made to preserve them, by
salting and smoking, and with perseverance this would
probably be successful, and a new dainty be added to
European tables. Such large numbers are occasionally
caught that they meet with no sale, and are thrown
away, or used as manure.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Sprats are a cheap delicacy with the lower classes in
this country, and are pretty plentiful at times, but they
are also greatly esteemed in the West India Islands.
A species, called the ‘yellow-tailed sprat,’ proves unfortunately
poisonous at certain periods of the year,
chiefly among the Leeward and Virgin Islands.</p>

<p>The cuckold or horned coney fish (<i>Monacanthus
tomentosus</i>) is much used as food, and, when stuffed
and baked, considered a delicacy.</p>

<p>Under the general name of the Spanish mackerel,
several species of <i>Cymbium</i>, <i>C. Caballa</i>, <i>C. regale</i>, and
<i>C. immaculata</i>, are caught in the West Indian seas.
They are a coarse, dry fish, and not much esteemed,
except when <i>coveeched</i>. To coveech a fish, it must be
cut into junks, fried with onions and oil, and afterwards
potted with vinegar, a little pepper or cloves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
fried onions, and some oil. It becomes an article
of trade in that manner, and a considerable quantity,
according to Sir Robert Schomburgk, is sent from the
Leeward Islands and Barbados to Guiana.</p>

<p>The young king-fish, termed <i>Coramour</i> in the West
Indies, kept in a fish pond or craal for some time, is
esteemed a great delicacy.</p>

<p>The mud-fish (<i>Eleotris gyrinus</i>), found in the water
courses of Antigua, is also considered a dainty. This
fish is common in the streamlets and creeks of the other
West Indian Islands, and is considered a most delicious
fish when in full perfection. It resembles the smelt in
appearance, and is easy of digestion.</p>

<p>The common cod of Newfoundland (<i>Morrhua vulgaris</i>)
is well known as an article of food the wide
world over. It is always a thick, well-fed fish, and
often attains a great weight, sometimes 70 or 80 lbs.,
and even more.</p>

<p>There is another variety, slightly, though permanently
distinct, the American cod, fine specimens of which
may be seen in the fish market of Halifax, Nova Scotia,
during the season; their quality is admirable.</p>

<p>Dried cod for the Brazils are packed in large flat
tubs, called drums, into which they are pressed by a
powerful screw. Each drum contains exactly 128 lbs.
of dry fish, that being the Portuguese quintal; and
the drums are shaped to suit the convenience of the
Brazilians, who transport them into the interior of
South America slung in pairs upon mules. For the
Mediterranean markets, the fish are stowed in the
holds of the vessels in bulk, and seldom receive damage,
such is the excellent manner in which they are cured and
stowed. The best and whitest of the cod are required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
for the Neapolitan market, for even the Lazzaroni of
Naples are very particular as to the quality of their fish.</p>

<p>On the coast of Norway, cod are caught in nets, and
it is stated by Mr. Laing, in his journal of a residence
in that country, that these nets are becoming more in
use every season. For this fishery, every boat is provided
with six or eight nets, each twenty fathoms in
length, and thirty meshes deep. The mesh of the
cod net is six inches from knot to knot, and is made of
three-ply hemp thread. The back ropes and ground
ropes of each net are fastened to the net, and the whole
are set like Scotch herring nets, only with longer buoy-ropes.
The cod nets are set at night, in 60 to 80
fathoms water, and are taken up in the morning. The
introduction of nets in the cod fishery is said to have
improved very considerably the condition of the inhabitants
of the coast of Norway, as by means of nets,
the quantity of fish caught has been nearly doubled.
It is not at all unlikely, that cod nets might be used
with advantage on the Gulf-coast of New Brunswick,
especially in the early part of each season, when the cod
come close to the shore in pursuit of herring, capelin,
and gaspereaux.</p>

<p>‘Some of the purely national dishes of Sweden, as
lut-fisk on Christmas-eve, are most extraordinary things,
lut-fisk being the stock fish steeped in a solution of potash
until in fact decomposition takes place. On Christmas-eve,
the great evening of Sweden, this thing is
boiled and eaten with oil sauce; and this, together with
grot, which is simply boiled rice, form the Christmas
dishes of Sweden, just as roast beef and plum pudding
do of England. The smell of the lut-fisk is terrific,
but a true Swede clings to his national dish on Julaften<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
as much as any beef-eating Englishman does to his.
The poor often substitute boiled corn for rice; and at
all times rye porridge made with milk, not water, is
their common food; the number of meals might seem
to make amends for their quality. Fish is almost the
staple of food; quantities are salted in the autumn,
and even in winter. They are taken in a most ingenious
manner from under ice. You see holes cut in certain
distances, and a man seated on a stool at the furthest
end on each side. The man you are looking at appears
to be sitting idly on the ice, but suddenly he puts his
hand into the small opening cut in it, and pulls up
a bright coloured little fish, and then another and another,
throwing them on the frozen lake, where they
jump about, displaying their colours, poor things, to
advantage, and suffering cruelly.’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Much more attention is now paid to the prosecution
of the fisheries, and the preparation of the fish for export,
in our North American colonies. Last season, an
enterprising firm in Carleton, New Brunswick, sent to
the Gulf of St. Lawrence a vessel of 30 tons, fitted
with the necessary apparatus and well supplied, for the
preparation of spiced salmon; which vessel, after an absence
of two months and a half, returned with a full
fare of the estimated value of £1,750, or yielding a
profit of about 700 per cent. on the outlay, with all
expenses defrayed!</p>

<p>A large New Brunswick vessel recently brought to
Liverpool 100 boxes, containing 1,200 tons of preserved
lobsters, of the presumed value of £300, also the result
of colonial enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>The flesh of the sea-perch or cunner (<i>Ctenolabrus
cæruleus</i>), sometimes called, on account of its prevailing
colour, the blue perch, is sweet and palatable. They
are skinned before being dressed. The fish is taken by
myriads, on the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The striped bass (<i>Labrax lineatus</i>) is a very fine
salt-water fish, and so is the diminutive white bass,
better known by its popular name ‘white perch.’ They
are a very fine fish for the table when in season. Their
ordinary weight is from four to six ounces in September;
they are often taken above half-a-pound in
weight; the largest seen weighed above a pound.</p>

<p>A schull of the striped bass, 500 or 600 in number,
weighing from 4 to 8 lbs. each, have often been taken
at one haul of the net, in New Brunswick. They
ascend fresh-water streams for shelter during the
winter, and were formerly taken in large quantities in
the Richibucto and Miramichi rivers. The fish gathered
in large shoals, lying in a dull, torpid state
under the ice, and holes being cut, they were taken in
nets in immense numbers, corded up stiff on the ice,
like fire-wood, and sent off in sled-loads to Fredericton
and St. John.</p>

<p>The chub is usually considered a coarse fish, but
those of large size, eaten fresh, are very palatable.
Mr. Yarrell says, ‘that boiling chub with the scales
on is the best mode of preparing it for table.’</p>

<p>‘The brook-trout of America’ (<i>Salmo fontinalis</i>), says
Mr. Herbert, ‘is one of the most beautiful creatures in
form, colour, and motion that can be imagined. There
is no sportsman, actuated by the true animus of the
pursuit, who would not prefer basketing a few brace
of good trout, to taking a cart-load of the coarser and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
less game denizens of the water. His wariness, his
timidity, his extreme cunning, the impossibility of taking
him in clear and much fished waters, except with the
slenderest and most delicate tackle—his boldness and
vigour after being hooked, and his excellence on the
table, place him without dispute next to the salmon
alone, as the first of fresh-water fishes. The pursuit of
him leads into the loveliest scenery of the land, and the
season at which he is fished for is the most delightful
portion of the year.’</p>

<p>The sea-trout of the basin of Bonaventura are of
large size, 3 lbs. and upwards, brilliantly white, in fine
condition, very fine and well flavoured.</p>

<p>The summer gaspereaux, or alewives, (<i>Alosa tyrannus</i>)
are an exceedingly fat fish, and well flavoured; the
only objection to them is their oily richness. Besides
their being fatter, they are smaller and more yellow in
colour than the spring fish.</p>

<p>To the epicure, a fresh caught salmon-trout of the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, especially early in the season,
will always afford a rich treat. The flesh is of a brilliant
pink colour, and most excellent: its exceeding fatness
early in the season, when it first enters the mixed
water of the estuaries, is such that it can be preserved
fresh but a very short time. The sportsman will find
it a thoroughly game fish; rising well at a brilliant fly
of scarlet ibis and gold, and affording sport second only
to salmon fishing. In some parts of the Gulf they have
been caught weighing 5 to 7 lbs.</p>

<p>That beautiful and savoury fish, the smelt, is a great
table delicacy with us; but on the Gulf coasts of New
Brunswick, large quantities are used every season merely
for manure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>As food, the skate is held in very different degrees of
estimation in different places. In London, large quantities
are consumed, and crimped skate is considered
delicate and well flavoured; but on some parts of the
English coast, although caught in considerable numbers,
the flesh is seldom eaten, and is only used for baiting lobster
pots. The French are great consumers of the skate;
and its flesh is used extensively both at New York and
Boston. By many it is deemed a great delicacy. After
the fish is skinned, the fleshy part of the huge pectoral
fins, which is beautifully white, is cut into long thin
slips, about an inch wide; these are rolled like ribbon,
and dressed in that form.</p>

<p>The capelan (<i>Mallotus villosus</i>), the smallest species of
the salmon family, possesses like the smelt the cucumber
smell, but it differs from the smelt in never entering
fresh-water streams. As an article of bait for cod, and
other fish of that class, the capelan is a fish of much
importance; whenever abundant, the cod-fishing is excellent.
It has been found as far north in the arctic
region as man has yet penetrated; and it forms so
important an article of food in Greenland, that it has
been termed the daily bread of the natives. In Newfoundland,
it is dried in large quantities, and exported
to London, where it is sold principally in the oyster shops.</p>

<p>The large, flat-fish known as the halibut (<i>Hippoglossus
vulgaris</i>), which sometimes attains the weight of
300 lbs, is often taken by the cod-fishers in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence. These fish are cut in slices, and pickled
in barrels, in which state they sell at half the price of
the best herrings. The flesh, though white and firm, is
dry, and the muscular fibres coarse. The fins and flaps
are however esteemed delicacies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>The mackerel of the British North American coasts
is of a much finer flavour than those caught on the
shores of Europe.</p>

<p>The salmon are also noted for their very fine flavour.</p>

<p>If there are no turbot, brill, or sole, in the St.
Lawrence, there are other delicacies. A species of eel
is exceedingly abundant and frequently of large size.
One of these, a sea-eel, split, salted, and smoked, without
the head, was 30 inches in length, and 15 inches in
diameter, breadth as split, nearly the size of an ordinary
smoked salmon and quite as thick. 300 barrels of
large eels, taken with the spear in the Buctouche river,
are usually salted-down for winter use. They are
generally excessively fat, the flesh very white and exceedingly
well flavoured. Packages of eels have been
lately imported into London from Prince Edward’s
Island. Smoked eels are very delicious, and they
have even begun to preserve these fish thus at Port
Phillip.</p>

<p>The fisheries of the North American lakes and rivers
are not prosecuted as they might be, but are beginning
to receive more attention. The white-fish (<i>Corregonus
albus</i>) is found in all the deep lakes west of the Mississippi,
and indeed from Lake Erie to the Polar Sea.
That which is taken in Leech Lake is said by amateurs
to be more highly flavoured than even that of Lake
Superior. There is another species of this fish, called
by the Indians tuliby or ottuniby (<i>Corregonus artidi</i>),
which resembles it, but is much less esteemed. Both
species furnish a wholesome and palatable food.</p>

<p>The French Canadians call this fish <i>Poisson Pointu</i>,
and the English term them ‘gizzard fish.’ The origin
of the latter name appears to be, that the fish feeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
largely on fresh-water shell fish and shelly molluscs;
and its stomach thereby gains an extraordinary thickness,
and resembles the gizzard of a fowl. The stomach,
when cleaned and boiled, is a favourite morsel with the
Canadian voyageurs.</p>

<p>The white-fish of the bays and lakes of Canada is
represented to be the finest fish in the world by the
Canadians. The flavour of it is incomparable, especially
when split open and fried with eggs and crumbs of
bread. They weigh on the average about 2 lbs. each
when cleaned—100 of them filling a good sized barrel.
Those caught in Lake Huron are more highly prized
than any others.</p>

<p>Several Indian tribes mainly subsist upon this fish,
and it forms the principal food at many of the fur
posts for eight or nine months of the year, the supply
of other articles of diet being scanty and casual. Its
usual weight in the northern regions is from 2 to 3 lbs.,
but it has been taken in the clear, deep, and cold
waters of Lake Huron, of the weight of 13 lbs. The
largest seen in the vicinity of Hudson’s Bay weighed
between 4 and 5 lbs., and measured 20 inches in
length, and 4 in depth. One of 7 lbs. weight, caught
in Lake Huron, was 27 inches long.</p>

<p>Among other species of fish that inhabit these great
inland seas are the mashkinonge, or mashkilonge, the
pike or jack, the pickerel or gilt carp, the perch, and a
species of trout called by the Chippeways, namogus.</p>

<p>A huge mashkilonge, so ravenous is its propensities,
is often caught from the stern of a steamer in full
speed, by throwing out a strong line with a small tin
fish attached. A marked peculiarity of most of the
Lake fish is the quantity of fat, resembling that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
quadrupeds, which they contain, entirely different from
the salt-water fish—while their flavor differs from that
of the latter, being much more delicate and white than
that of river fish.</p>

<p>Lake Superior abounds with fish, particularly trout,
sturgeon, and white-fish, which are caught at all seasons
and in large quantities. Of these the trout, weighing
from 12 to 50 lbs., and the white-fish, weighing
often over 20 lbs., are perhaps the most important.</p>

<p>The salmon trout are equally large, weighing from
10 to 70 lbs.</p>

<p>Lake Champlain also abounds with fish, among which
are salmon, lake-shad, pike, and other fish.</p>

<p>The reciprocity treaty has given a new field to the
fisheries on the Canada side of Lake Huron. Some
200 American fishermen are now engaged within fifty
miles each side of Goderich in the business. This has
greatly stimulated the Cannucks, and it is estimated 400
of them are now engaged in the same business. About
100 miles of the Lake shore is lined with gill nets and
seines. Every boat that comes in has a large number
of salmon-trout from 30 to 50 lbs. weight. White-fish
are very large. The fish caught at Collingwood
terminus of the northern railway, from Toronto, are
packed in ice, and go to Oswego, Rome, Utica, Albany,
and New York. Great quantities taken at Goderich go
in ice from thence to Cleveland and Cincinnati.</p>

<p>The Toronto and Oswego markets are supplied with
fish from Collingwood, and a well organized company,
with nets, ice-houses, &amp;c., might do a fine business by
supplying the New York, Boston, and other American
markets, daily with trout, bass, and white-fish from the
waters of Georgian Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Fishing with the scoop net is the most laborious of
all modes of fishing. It was found in practice at the
Sault St. Marie by the Baron De Hortan, when he
penetrated to that point in 1684. It has been practised
ever since, because it is the only mode by which the
white-fish can be taken. They go there to feed and
not to spawn; the bottom of the river is a rocky broken
ground, and the current runs at the rate of 12 miles per
hour; the eddy in which the fish are found is of small
circuit, and only one canoe at a time can enter it. The
canoe is forced into it by setting poles. The man in
the bow has a scoop net, the handle to which is about
15 feet in length. He has only time to make one
stroke with the scoop, the next instant the canoe is
whirled away by the current far below the point where
the stroke was made.</p>

<p>The plunge of the scoop may be successful or not
according to chance; one fish or half-a-dozen may be
taken, or very frequently none. As soon as one canoe
is thus swept away, another one supplies its place, and in
this manner some eight or ten canoes in rapid succession
take their turn. Canoes are used because, being lighter,
they can be forced up where it would not be possible to
put a boat. Even though the white-fish would take
the hook, still in such rapid water it could not be used.</p>

<p>Again, the character of nearly the whole of the coasts
of Lakes Huron and Superior forbids any other mode of
fishing than by gill nets.</p>

<p>Gill nets are often set in 60 feet of water, and the
fish cannot be taken at such localities in any other
mode, except at some seasons of the year when they
will take the hook.</p>

<p>Again, there are localities along Lake Superior,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
where fish such as the rock sturgeon and mashkilonge
can only be taken with the spear, and that in 30 feet
water; the bottom is so disturbed, distorted, upheaved,
and broken by volcanic action, that gill nets cannot be
used, and the fish can only be reached in the hollows,
crevices, and chasms of the rock where they lie, by
means of a spear, which is thrown and has a line attached
to the extremity.</p>

<p>The <i>Lake Superior Journal</i> says:—‘Angling through
the ice to a depth of 30 fathoms of water is a novel
mode of fishing somewhat peculiar to this peculiar
region of the world. It is carrying the war into fishdom
with a vengeance, and is denounced, no doubt, in
the communities on the bottoms of these northern lakes
as a scaly piece of warfare. The large and splendid
salmon-trout of these waters have no peace; in the
summer they are enticed into the deceitful meshes of the
gill-net, and in the winter, when they hide themselves
in the deep caverns of the lakes, with fifty fathoms of
water above their heads, and a defence of ice two or
three feet in thickness on the top of that, they are
tempted to destruction by the fatal hook. Large numbers
of these trout are caught every winter in this way
on Lake Superior. The Indian, always skilled in the
fishing business, knows exactly where to find them and
how to kill them. The whites make excursions out on
the Lake in pleasant weather to enjoy this sport.
There is a favourite resort for both fish and fishermen
near Gros Cap, at the entrance of Lake Superior,
through the rocky gateway between Gros Cap and
Point Iroquois, about 18 miles above the Sault, and
many a large trout at this point is pulled up from its
warm bed at the bottom of the Lake in winter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
made to bite the cold ice in this upper world. To see
one of these fine fish, four or five feet in length, and
weighing half as much as a man, floundering on the
snow and ice, weltering and freezing to death in its own
blood, oftentimes moves the heart of the fisherman to
expressions of pity. The <i>modus operandi</i> in this kind
of great trout fishing is novel in the extreme, and could
a stranger to the business overlook at a distance a party
engaged in the sport, he would certainly think they
were mad, or each one making foot-races against time.
A hole is made through the ice, smooth and round, and
the fisherman drops down his large hook, baited with a
small herring, pork, or other meat, and when he ascertains
the right depth, he waits—with fisherman’s luck—some
time for a bite, which in this case is a pull altogether,
for the fisherman throws the line over his
shoulders and walks from the hole at the top of his
speed till the fish bounds out on the ice. I have
known of as many as fifty of these splendid trout caught
in this way by a single fisherman in a single day; it is
thus a great source of pleasure and a valuable resource
of food, especially in Lent; and the most scrupulous
anti-pork believers might here ‘down pork and up
fish’ without any offence to conscience.’</p>

<p>The Cleveland <i>Plain-dealer</i> has a lengthy account
of the trade of the house of J. M. Craw and Son, of
that city. It says:—‘At the warehouse, 133, River street,
in this city, is a grand depôt of its receipts.
From this place large supplies of salt provisions, fisherman’s
tackle, seines, lines, and everything needed on the
coasts of the upper lakes, are forwarded. At Washington
Harbour, in Green Bay, engagements are made with
the fishermen of 118 boats, each of which has a head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
fisherman, who has his crew engaged in fishing. Over
300 men are constantly engaged, spring and fall, in that
locality in catching, packing, and forwarding fish. Similar
settlements of fishermen are scattered all along the
coasts of Lakes Michigan, Superior, Huron, and Erie.
The number of varieties of Lake fish fit for packing is
large, including white-fish, siskawit, trout, pickerel, cat-fish,
bass, herring, perch, shad, and bayfish. The
amount of fish received by Craw and Son, in 1856, exceeded
14,000 barrels, and as their receipts this year
from Lake Michigan will be about 6,000 barrels, an increased
aggregate is anticipated. This large amount is
so much added to the food of the country, and constitutes
an important addition to its wealth. From the
details of this single house we may learn something of
the extent of the entire trade.’</p>

<p>In the Baikal Lake, Siberia, there is a fish (<i>Callyonimus
Baicalensis</i>) from four to six inches long, so very
fat, that it melts before the fire like butter. It yields
an oil sold to great advantage to the Chinese.</p>

<p>The <i>Lake Superior Journal</i>, of October 27, notices
the arrival of a 100 barrels of the famous siskawit from
Isle Royale, and learns from one of the fishermen that
there have been caught this season between 300 and
400 barrels of this fish, together with a few trout and
white fish. They fish on that island for this fish principally,
as the siskawit are worth as much again as
whitefish and mackinac trout in the lake markets.—The
siskawit is said to be the fattest fish that swims, either
in fresh or salt water. The fishermen assert, that one
of these fish, when hung up by the tail in the hot sun
of a summer day, will melt and entirely disappear,
except the bones. In putting up about 50 barrels this
season, one of the fishermen made two and a half barrels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
of oil from the heads and ‘leaf fat’ alone, without
the least injury to the marketableness of the fish.
Besides this leaf fat, the fat or oil is disseminated ‘in a
layer of fat and a layer of lean’ throughout the fish.
They are too fat to be eaten fresh, and are put up for
market like whitefish and trout.</p>

<p>‘Fish being here very scarce,’ (Falls of the Uaupés,)
‘we were obliged,’ says Mr. Wallace, ‘to live almost
entirely on fowls, which, though very nice when well
roasted, and with the accompaniment of ham and gravy,
are rather tasteless, simply boiled or stewed, with no
variation in the cookery, and without vegetables.</p>

<p>‘I had now got so thoroughly into the life of this
part of the country, that like everybody else here, I
preferred fish to every other article of food. One
never tires, and I must again repeat, that I believe
there are fish here superior to any in the world.</p>

<p>‘Our fowls cost us about a penny each, paid in fish-hooks
or salt, so that they are not such expensive food
as they would be at home. In fact, if a person buys
his hooks, salt, and other things in Para, where they are
about half the price they are in Barra, the price of a fowl
will not exceed a halfpenny; and fish, pacovas, and other
eatables that this country produces, in the same proportion.</p>

<p>‘Many of the fish of the Rio Negro are of a most excellent
flavour, surpassing anything I have tasted in
England, either from the fresh or the salt waters; and
many species have real fat, which renders the water
they are boiled in a rich and agreeable broth. Not a
drop of this is wasted, but with a little pepper and farinha
is all consumed, with as much relish as if it were the
most delicate soup.’<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>Pirarucú, the dried fish, which with farinha forms
the chief subsistence of the native population of Brazil,
and in the interior is the only thing to be obtained,
resembles in appearance nothing eatable, looking as
much like a dry cow-hide, grated up into fibres, and
dressed into cakes, as anything I can compare it with.
When eaten, it is boiled or slightly roasted, pulled to
pieces and mixed with vinegar, oil, pepper, onions, and
farinha, and altogether forms a very savoury mess for
a person with a good appetite and a strong stomach.</p>

<p>If we pass to the Pacific coasts of South America,
we find the most esteemed fish are the robalo, the
corvino, the lisa, and the king-fish.</p>

<p>The robalo (<i>Esox Chilensis</i>, <i>Hemiramphus Brazillensis</i>
of Cuvier,) is nearly of a cylindrical form, and from
two to three feet long. It is coated with angular scales
of a golden colour upon the back, and silver on the
belly; the fins are soft and without spines, the tail is
truncated, and the back marked longitudinally with
a blue stripe, bordered with yellow. The flesh is very
white, almost transparent, light, and of a delicious
taste. Those taken upon the Araucanian coast are the
most in repute, where they are sometimes caught of
eight pounds weight. The Indians of Chiloe smoke
them, after having cleaned and soaked them for 24
hours in sea water, and, when sufficiently dry, pack
them up in casks of 100 each, which are generally sold
for about three dollars. The robalo prepared in this
manner is said to be superior to any other kind of
dried fish.</p>

<p>The corvino (<i>Sparus Chilensis</i>) is nearly of the same
size as the robalo; it is sometimes, however, found of
five or six feet in length. This fish has a small head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
and a large oval body, covered with broad, rhomboidal
scales, of a mother-of-pearl colour, marked with white.
The tail is forked, and the body encircled obliquely,
from the shoulders to the belly, with a number of
brownish lines. The fins are armed with spiny rays,
and the flesh is white, firm, and of a good taste, particularly
when fried. It would probably be better
still if it were prepared like that of the tunny.</p>

<p>The lisa (<i>Mugil Chilensis</i>) in its form, scales, and
back is much like the common mullet, but is distinguished
by the dorsal fin, which in the lisa is entire.
There are two species of this fish, the sea and the river
lisa, neither of which exceeds a foot in length; the first
is a very good fish, but the latter is so exquisite, that
it is preferred by many to the best of trout.</p>

<p>Another esteemed fresh-water fish of Chile is the
bagre, or luvur (<i>Silenus Chilensis</i>, probably the <i>A.
geneionis inermis</i>), which has a smooth skin, without
scales, and is brown upon the sides, and whitish under
the belly. In appearance, it is not very prepossessing,
for in form it resembles a tadpole; the head being of a
size disproportionate to the length of the body, which
does not exceed eleven inches at the most. It has a
blunt mouth, furnished like that of the barbel with
barbs. It has a sharp spine on the back fins, like the
tropical bagre, but its puncture is not venomous, as
that is said to be. The flesh is yellow, and the most
delicious of any esculent fish that is known. There is
said to be another species of this fish inhabiting the
sea, which is black—the same, probably, that Anson’s
sailors called, from its colour, the chimney-sweep.</p>

<p>While on the subject of fish common to this locality,
I may mention that the Abbé Molina states, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
‘the river Talten, which waters the Araucanian provinces,
produces a small fish called <i>paye</i>, which, as I
have been assured by those who have seen them, is so
diaphanous, that if several are placed upon each other,
any object beneath them may be distinctly seen. If
this property is not greatly exaggerated, this fish
might serve to discover the secret process of digestion
and the motion of the fluids.’</p>

<p>Mr. Ruschenberger thus describes a Hawaiian restaurant:—‘The
earth floor of a straw hovel was covered
by mats. Groups of men squatted in a circle, with
gourd plates before them, supplied with raw fish and
salt-water, and by their side was an enormous gourd, of
the dimensions of a wash tub, filled with poë, a sort of
paste made of taro. They ate of the raw fish, occasionally
sopping the torn animal in the salt water as a
sauce, then sucking it, with that peculiar smack which
indicates the reception of a delicious morsel.’</p>

<p>The noble salmon, which honest Izaak Walton justly
calls, ‘the king of fresh-water fish,’ is too well known
as a choice article of food to need description. A jowl of
fresh salmon was one of the requisites, in 1444, at the
feast of the Goldsmiths’ Company; and in 1473, three
quarters of Colnbrook salmon are charged 6<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>;
and at a fish dinner of the same company in 1498,
among large quantities of fish mentioned, are a fresh
salmon 11<i>s.</i>; a great salmon £1; and two salmon-trout
2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> In 1518, for ij. fresh samon xvijˢ jᵈ
Item, a fresh samon xiijˢ iiijᵈ; and in the eighth year
of King Henry VIII. iiij. fresh samons are charged xlˢ</p>

<p>In the great rush after gold, the fisheries of the
Pacific coast, which have been famous for years past
for their extent and value, have not received that attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
which they merit. Now that the living tide has
again set in strongly towards the North-West, the demand
for food to feed the thousands will cause the
fishery to be more largely developed. The whole
coast is particularly rich in the more valuable species
of the finny tribe.</p>

<p>A San Francisco paper states:—‘The salmon of
California and Oregon, with which our markets are
supplied in the fresh and cured state, are nowhere surpassed
in quality or flavour. Our rivers, bays, and
estuaries are alive with these valuable fish, and the
fishermen are busy in securing them during the present
run. It is estimated that there are 400 boats on the
Sacramento river alone, engaged in fisheries. The
boats are valued at 60,000 dollars, the nets at 80,000
dollars, and seines at 6,000 dollars. The fishing season
lasts from the 1st of February to the 1st of August,
during which time the estimated average of each boat
per day is 30 dollars, or an aggregate of 12,000
dollars. The hauling seines yield 100 dollars each per
day, or 2,000 dollars in the aggregate. The fish thus
caught supply the markets of San Francisco, Sacramento,
Marysville, and the mining towns in the interior.
Sometimes 2,000 lbs. are sent to one order. The
amount shipped daily to San Francisco at present is
from 5,000 to 6,000 lbs., which will be increased as the
season advances.</p>

<p>‘The fishing smacks outside the harbour in the vicinity
of Drake’s Bay, Punto de los Reyes, Tomales,
and similar points, as well as other portions of the
coast, are busily engaged in the trade.</p>

<p>‘This business is becoming every year of greater interest,
and the attention of our legislature has recently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
been drawn to its proper regulation and protection. A
description of the fishes common to these waters, with
an account of their habits, quality, and relative value,
would be of great interest.</p>

<p>‘In addition to salmon there are other varieties of
fish deserving more than a passing notice. Much difficulty
is experienced in classifying them under the
proper heads, and recognizing the species under their
various arbitrary names. The sturgeon, the rock cod,
the mackerel—which, although it bears some resemblance
to the Atlantic fish is inferior to it in flavour
and fatness—the herring, the smelt, the sardine, and
other varieties found in our markets, are all more or
less valuable. Myriads of sardines abound along the
whole southern coast. The Bay of Monterey has especially
become famous for its abundance of this small
but valuable fish. It is a matter of surprise that the
taking and preparation of this fish, which enters so
largely into the commerce of the world, has never been
attended to as a source of revenue and profit in this
region. The experiment certainly is worth testing.
There are doubtless many persons here, familiar with
the trade as practised on the coast of France, whose
services might be secured in the business.’</p>

<p>Another Californian paper, the <i>Sacramento Union</i>,
remarks:—‘The fishing interest in the Sacramento at
this point is increasing and expanding with astonishing
rapidity, from year to year, and from month to month.
The water of the river must be alive with salmon,
or such numbers caught daily would sensibly reduce
their numbers. But experienced fishermen inform us,
while the run lasts, so countless is the number, that no
matter how many are employed in the business, or how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
many are taken daily, no diminution can be perceived.
Even the ‘tules’ between this and the Coast Range
are reported to be filled with salmon. The run this
year is said to be greater than ever before known at
this season. The extraordinary run of the present
time is only expected to continue for something like
three weeks. They seem to run in immense schools,
with some weeks intervening between the appearance
of each school, during which the numbers taken are
light, as compared with the quantity taken during a
time like the present. No account is kept of the number
engaged in fishing, or of the amount caught, and
all statements relative thereto are made from estimates
obtained from those who have experience in
the business, and probably approximate correctness.
These estimates give the number of men employed
now in taking fish in the Sacramento at about 6OO—the
number of fish taken daily, on an average, at 2,000—their
average weight 17 lbs., making 34,000 lbs. per
day. Two cents per lb., which is probably more than
the present average price by the quantity, would give
a daily income to those employed of 680 dollars, not
very high pay. Either the number of men engaged in
the business, we imagine, must be over estimated, or
the number of fish caught under estimated. It requires
two men to man a boat, which would give 300
boats for 600 men: 2,000 fish a day would give to each
man a fraction over three as his share. We presume
few are fishing who do not catch a good many more
than that number. We saw a boat-load, the product
of the previous night, consisting of 66 salmon, weighed
yesterday morning. They averaged a fraction over
17 lbs., and gave 33 as the number caught by each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
man, instead of three, as estimated above. Say the
600 fishermen man, on an average, 200 boats a night;
the average number caught by each boat put at 20,
and the sum total would be 4,000 fish, instead of 2,000,
as estimated. Our impression is that the latter comes
nearer the mark than the former, as a good many of
the fishermen send their fish directly to San Francisco;
others take them to different points for salting. Large
numbers are salted down daily, several firms and individuals
being extensively engaged in this branch of the
trade. The fish are put down in hogsheads, which
average, when filled, about 800 lbs. From 1,000 to
3,000 lbs. are put down daily by those engaged
in salting. An acquaintance has filled 65 hogsheads
this season. The most of those engaged in salting
live on the Washington side of the river, and salt their
fish there. Including those engaged in salting, catching,
and selling, probably the fish business furnishes
employment for 1,000 men.’</p>

<p>The salmon is found in no other waters in such vast
multitudes as are met in the rivers emptying into
the Pacific. On the Atlantic side, the leading fish feature
is the run of shad in the spring; on the Pacific
side, salmon ascend the rivers at all seasons, in numbers
beyond all computation. In California and Oregon,
the rivers are alive with them; the great number
taken by fishermen are but a drop from the bucket.
Above this, on the coast side, tribes of Indians use no
other food. As a table luxury, they are esteemed by
most persons the finest fish caught. Unlike many fish,
they contain but few bones, and the orange-coloured
meat can be served in slices to suit customers. It is
emphatically the meat for the million; it costs so little—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
a quarter that of other meats—that rich and poor
can feast upon salmon as often in the day as they choose
to indulge in the luxury. In the course of a few years,
salmon fishing will extend itself to all the prominent
rivers in the North Pacific States. Catching and curing
salmon will then have become a systematized business;
the fish consumption will then have extended itself
generally over those States, and more than likely become,
in the meantime, an important article of export.</p>

<p>While upon the subject of these fisheries, it may be
added, that a considerable portion of the Chinese population,
both at San Francisco and at Sacramento, have
engaged extensively in this business. In the vicinity of
Mission Creek, near the former city, they have gone into
the business upon a large scale. The average ‘catch,’
each day, is estimated at about 5,000 lbs., for which
a ready market is found among the Chinese population,
at five dollars per cwt. The process of catching,
cleaning, and curing, presents a busy and curious scene.</p>

<p>Sir John Bowring remarks that, ‘The multitudes
of persons who live by the fisheries in China afford
evidence not only that the land is cultivated to the
greatest possible extent, but that it is insufficient to
supply the necessities of the overflowing population;
for agriculture is held in high honour in China, and the
husbandman stands next in rank to the sage, or literary
man, in the social hierarchy. It has been supposed that
nearly a tenth of the population derive their means of
support from fisheries. Hundreds and thousands of
boats crowd the whole coasts of China—sometimes
acting in communities, sometimes independent and
isolated. There is no species of craft by which a fish
can be inveigled which is not practised with success in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
China. Every variety of net, from vast seines, embracing
miles, to the smallest hand-filet in the care of a
child. Fishing by night and fishing by day—fishing
in moonlight, by torchlight, and in utter darkness—fishing
in boats of all sizes—fishing by those who are
stationary on the rock by the seaside, and by those who
are absent for weeks on the wildest of seas—fishing by
cormorants—fishing by divers—fishing with lines,
with baskets—by every imaginable decoy and device.
There is no river which is not staked to assist the fisherman
in his craft. There is no lake, no pond, which
is not crowded with fish. A piece of water is nearly as
valuable as a field of fertile land. At daybreak every
city is crowded with sellers of live fish, who carry their
commodity in buckets of water, saving all they do not
sell to be returned to the pond or kept for another day’s
service.</p>

<p>The fishing grounds of Van Diemen’s Land are periodically
visited by a splendid fish named arbouka, a
well-known piscatory visitant on the coast of New
Zealand. Great numbers of these beautiful denizens of
the deep have been caught, varying in weight from
60 lbs. to 100 lbs. each. The trumpeter is one of the
most magnificent of Tasmanian fish; and is unrivalled
in the quality of its flesh by any visitant in those waters.
A demand has been created for them in Victoria; and
before long, a stirring trade will be established between
the two colonies in these beautiful fish.</p>

<p>The native cooking-oven of New Zealand, called the
unu, is a very curious contrivance, and is thus described
by Mr. S. C. Brees. It consists of a round hole,
about two or three feet in diameter, and twelve inches
deep, in which some wood is placed and lighted. Large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
pebble-stones are then thrown on the fire and heated,
which remain at the bottom of the hole after the wood
is consumed; the stones are next arranged, so as to
present a level surface, and sprinkled with water; wild
cabbage or other leaves are moistened and spread over
them, upon which the food intended to be cooked is
laid; the whole is then covered over with leaves and
flax-baskets, and lastly, filled over with earth, which
completes the operation. After allowing it to remain a
certain time, according to circumstances, which the
cook determines with the utmost precision, the oven is
opened and the food removed. Eels and potatoes are
delicious when cooked in this manner, and every other
kind of provision.</p>

<p>The seer-fish (<i>Cybium guttatum</i>) is generally considered
the finest flavoured of the finny race that swims
in the Indian seas; it has a good deal the flavour of
salmon.</p>

<p>There are several esteemed fish obtained round
Ceylon. The Pomfret bull’s eye (<i>Holocentrus ruber</i>) is
found at certain seasons in abundance on the southern
coast of Ceylon, in deep water. It is greatly esteemed
by the natives as an article of food, and reaches a considerable
size, frequently nearly two feet in length. The
flesh is white and solid. For splendour and beauty,
this fish is almost unsurpassed.</p>

<p>A fish called by the natives great-fire (<i>Scorpæna
volitans</i>) is eaten by the native fishermen, the flesh
being white, solid, and nutritive. Linnæus describes
the flesh as delicious.</p>

<p>The pookoorowah (<i>Holocentrus argenteus</i>) is a very
delicious fish, seldom exceeding twelve or thirteen
inches in length. The gal-handah (<i>Chætodon araneus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></i>),
a singular and much admired fish, only about
three inches in length, has a delicate and white flesh,
and is greatly esteemed.</p>

<p>In Java and Sumatra, a preparation of small fish,
with red-rice, having the appearance of anchovies, and
the colour of red-cabbage, is esteemed a delicacy. So
in India, the preparation called tamarind fish is much
prized as a breakfast relish, where the acid of the
tamarind is made use of for preserving the white
pomfret-fish, cut in transverse slices. The mango-fish
(<i>Polynemus longifilis</i>, Cuvier; <i>P. paradiscus</i> of Linnæus),
about eight or nine inches long by two deep,
is much esteemed in India. At Calcutta the <i>Lates
nobilis</i>, different species of <i>Polynemus</i>, and the <i>Mugil
Corsula</i>, daily cover the tables of Europeans, who will
more readily recognize these fishes under the names
of the <i>Begti</i> or <i>Cockup</i>, <i>Sudjeh</i>, <i>Tupsi</i>, and the Indian
Mullet.</p>

<p>At the Sandheads may be found some of those delicious
fishes, which are more familiar to the residents
of Madras and Bombay, for instance, the Indian soles,
the roll-fish, and above all, the black and white pomfrets,
and the bummolah, which latter in a dried state is
known by the name of the Bombay duck. The bummolah
is a small glutinous transparent fish, about the
size of smelt.</p>

<p>There are many excellent fish obtained from the sea
round the Cape Colony, and about 2,500 tons are
shipped annually to the Mauritius, forming nearly three
fourths of the island consumption; the principal consumers
being the coolie labourers or Indian population.</p>

<p>Geelbeck, or yellow mouth, sometimes called Cape
salmon (<i>Otolithus æquidens</i>, Cuv. and Val.), is the finest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
as to quality; they are taken abundantly with the hook
and line, or net, and weigh about 14 lbs. The cost of preparation
ready for shipment is about £12. It forms an
article of food for the poor and lazy. The Malays at the
Cape cure a great deal in vinegar (for home consumption),
the same as pickled salmon in England; and it is
not a bad representative of it. For exportation they
are opened down the back, the intestines taken out,
head cut off, salted for a night, and dried in the sun.</p>

<p>Snook (<i>Thyrsites atua</i>), similar to the baraconta, is
a long, slim, oily fish, taken with any shining bait; it is
a perfect salt-water pike, very strong and ferocious, and
is dispatched, after being pulled on board, by blows
on the head with a kind of knob-kerrie. These are
cured the same way as the geelbeck; the cost of production
is about £16 per ton. They are highly prized
by the colonists, and esteemed before any fish imported
into Mauritius, fetching about £2 per ton more than
cod. These fish are very fine eating when cured fresh.
They are also much esteemed in Ceylon. The Malays
cure them without salt by drying in the sun, with a
little pepper and spice; they are then delicious.</p>

<p>Silver fish (<i>Dentex argyrozona</i>) are similar to the
bream of England; each weighs from 6 to 8 lbs. They
are got up for shipment the same as the others; the cost
of production is about £10 per ton. They are the least
esteemed of any at the Mauritius market, but when
fresh they are very nice eating. The bastard silver
fish (<i>D. rupestris</i>) is considered one of the very finest
fishes in the colony. It is esteemed for foreign markets.
Harders are a mullet, about eight inches long, which
are principally cured in small casks in brine, for up-country
use. The Cape farmers are very fond of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
but few are exported. They have also mackerel very
large, very fat, which are better cured than fresh.</p>

<p>The Jacob Evertsen (<i>Sebastes capensis</i>), so called after
a Dutch captain, remarkable for a red face and large
projecting eyes, is a fish which, though common in
Table Bay almost at all seasons, is highly prized for its
flesh by most colonists. Another species, the sancord
(<i>S. maculatus</i>), which is not so common, is a very delicious
fish. The kabeljauw (<i>Sciæna hololepidota</i>) is a
large fish from two to three feet long, common on the
coast, being caught with the hook and the drag-net. It
is one of the staple fishes in the Cape Town market;
dried and salted like cod it is exported to the Mauritius
and elsewhere. Its flesh when young is good, but firm
and dry in adult individuals. The baardmannetje
(<i>Umbrina capensis</i>, Pappe), another newly described
fish of the same family, which is chiefly caught in False
Bay during summer, measures from 2 to 2½ feet, and
is reputed for its delicious flesh.</p>

<p>The hangberger (<i>Sargus Hottentotus</i>), a fish about
18 inches long, which is common in Table Bay from
June to August, is much in request, particularly at the
time when it is with roe. It is also cured and pickled
for economical purposes. It feeds on shell fish, and is
caught with the hook.</p>

<p>The Hottentot fish (<i>Sargus capensis</i>), from 12 to 14
inches long, which is mostly confined to Table Bay and
the West Coast, may be caught at all seasons with
the hook. It is not only a superior table fish, but
forms when salted and dried an article of export.</p>

<p>The roode steen brassem of the Dutch (<i>Chrysophrys
laticeps</i>, Cuvier) is a bulky fish, often exceeding 3½
feet in length and 14 inches in breadth. It is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
voracious, and feeds generally on crabs and cuttle fish
(<i>Sepia</i> and <i>Loligo</i>). As food it is much prized, and
is also cured for exportation.</p>

<p>The Roman fish (<i>Chrysophrys cristiceps</i>) is one of
the prettiest and most delicious fish met with in the
Cape markets. It is generally acknowledged to be a
superior dish.</p>

<p>The daggerath (<i>Pagrus laniarius</i>) is of a dark rose
colour, about 12 inches long. It is highly prized in
the colony for its delicious flesh. This handsome fish
owes its surname, <i>laniarius</i> (butcher), both to its colour
and to its sharp teeth and voracity.</p>

<p>The windtoy (<i>Cantharus Blochii</i>) is a delicious table
fish, more commonly caught in winter, and often put up
in bundles along with the Hottentot fish (<i>Sargus capensis</i>).
The flesh of the dasje fish, another species (<i>Cantharus
emarginatus</i>), is also highly esteemed as food.</p>

<p>There is a fish called by the colonists the bamboo
fish (<i>Boops salpa</i>), from feeding on algæ and being
caught principally in localities where there is an
abundance of sea-weed. On account of its vegetable
nourishment, it exhibits at times a particular smell when
embowelled, and is for that reason called stink-fish by
some of the fishermen. It is a rich and delicate fish,
and though scarce in the Cape Town market, is common
in Saldanha Bay, where it is dried and salted for
home consumption.</p>

<p>The flesh of the bastard Jacob Evertsen (<i>Pimelepterus
fuscus</i>) is well flavoured and very nice. This
fish is of a uniform dusky brown colour. It feeds on
shell-fish.</p>

<p>The galleon fish (<i>Dipterodon capensis</i>) is more plentiful
in the western division of the Cape Colony; it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
highly esteemed as food and always fetches a good
price. It is, however, disliked by some on account of
the many black veins traversing its flesh, and is at
times rather unwholesome, from being too rich and requiring
good digestive organs.</p>

<p>The elft-fish (<i>Temnodon saltator</i>) is uniformly lead
coloured, shaded with dark green on its back. From
leaping now and then out of the water it has obtained
its name of <i>saltator</i> (jumper). It is held in great
esteem as a table fish, and the younger individuals are
truly deemed a dainty.</p>

<p>There are several species of mullet recorded as inhabitants
of the bays and rivers of the Cape Colony.
All of them are caught with the net. They make good
table fish, but are more frequently salted or smoke-dried
(under the name of bokkoms) like the herring,
and thus preserved, form a very considerable article of
home consumption as well as of export.</p>

<p>The klip-fish (<i>Blennius versicolor</i>, Pappe) is greatly
reputed for its flesh, which is nice, well flavoured, and
wholesome.</p>

<p>The flesh of the bagger (<i>Bagrus capensis</i>) is extremely
delicate, and bears a greater resemblance to
that of the eel than that of any other sea fish in the
colony. Owing to its ugliness, this curious fish, which
hides itself among stones in muddy water the better to
entrap its unsuspecting prey, is from popular prejudice
less prized than it deserves.</p>

<p>English writers on Ichthyology comment very unfavourably
on the merits of the hake (<i>Gadus merluccius</i>)
and call it ‘a coarse fish, scarcely fit for the dinner
table.’ At the Cape its qualities are generally and
fully appreciated; in fact, its flesh is highly delicate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
little inferior to that of the haddock (<i>Gadus æglefinus</i>).
At times it makes its appearance in large shoals. It is
then abundantly caught, salted, and dried, for exportation.
The cured or dried Cape stock-fish is an excellent
dish, far superior to that insipid stuff introduced from
Holland or other countries.</p>

<p>The rock-cod (<i>Serranus Cuvierii</i>) is highly esteemed
as an article of food.</p>

<p>Sardines in myriads swarm round Table Bay, at one
season of the year; klip-fish, king klip-fish, and soles
(rather scarce), are considered a luxury.</p>

<p>It is hardly requisite to say much of that cosmopolitan
fish, the sole, which is for its delicacy prized as
well at the Cape as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thousands of cray-fish are caught daily; four of the
largest can be obtained for a penny; but it is not fashionable
to eat them, although they are very good.</p>

<p>The quantity of fish throughout the whole extent of
the coast, bordering on the Agulha’s bank, is immense,
and would be the richest fishery in the world. Exports
of sardines in the French style, of potted cray-fish in
the American, and the choicest fish preserved fresh in
tins, might be made profitable.</p>

<p>I may add here that Dr. L. Pappe, of Cape Town,
to whom I am indebted for my information on the Cape
fishes, has published in the Colony an interesting
synopsis of the edible fishes at the Cape of Good Hope,
in which he furnishes much new and interesting descriptive
scientific detail.</p>

<p>Insects furnish more food delicacies than is generally
supposed. In the popular <i>Introduction to Entomology</i>,
by Kirby and Spence, it is well remarked, that,</p>

<p>‘If we could lay aside our English prejudices, there
is no reason why some of the insects might not be eaten,
for those used by various nations as food, generally
speaking, live on vegetable substances, and are consequently
much more select and cleanly in their diet than
the pig or the duck, which form a favourite part of our
food. They who would turn with disgust from a
locust, or the grub of a beetle, feel no symptoms of
nausea when a lobster, crab, or shrimp is set before
them. The fact is, that habit has reconciled us to the
eating of these last, which, viewed in themselves,
with their threatening claws, and many feet, are
really more disgusting than the former. Had the habit
been reversed, we should have viewed the former with
appetite, and the latter with abhorrence—as do the
Arabs, who are as much astounded at our eating crabs,
lobsters, and oysters, as we are at their eating locusts.’</p>

<p>Herrick, an old author, 200 years ago, in describing
a feast given by Oberon to the fairy elves, alludes to
the insects as amongst their choicest cates.</p>

<p class="c">COLEOPTERA.</p>

<p>Many larvæ of insects, and especially of beetles, are
eaten in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>The grub of the palm weevil (<i>Cordylia palmarum</i>),
which is the size of the thumb, has long been in request
in the East and West Indies. The natives of
Surinam roast and eat them as something exquisite.
In Jamaica, where it is known as the grou-grou worm,
I have seen it eaten commonly. A grub named <i>Macauco</i>
is also there in request at the principal tables.
It is eaten both by whites and blacks, who empty,
wash, and roast them, and find them delicious. A
similar insect is dressed at Mauritius, and eaten by all
classes.</p>

<p>An old writer—Brookes, <i>On the Properties and Uses
of Insects</i>, 1772, says—‘They are eaten by the French,
in the West Indies, after they have been roasted before
the fire, when a small wooden spit has been thrust
through them. When they begin to be hot, they powder
them with a crust of rasped bread, mixed with salt,
and a little pepper and nutmeg. This powder keeps in
the fat, or at least, sucks it up; and when they are
done enough, they are served up with orange juice.
They are highly esteemed by the French, as excellent
eating.’</p>

<p>The larva, or grub, of one of the species of beetles
which infest cocoa-nut trees, is called <i>Tucuma</i>, or <i>Grugou</i>,
in British Guiana. It is about two or three inches
long, and three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and
the head is black. They are reckoned a great delicacy
by wood-cutters and epicures of the country, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
are generally dressed by frying them in a pan. By
some they are preferred in a raw state, and after seizing
them by the black head, they are dipped in lime-juice,
and forthwith swallowed.</p>

<p>The late Mr. J. C. Bidwell, a botanist, travelling in
Australia, states—‘I never before tasted one of the large
grubs, which are a favourite food of the blacks. They
are about four inches long, and about as thick as a finger.
They inhabit the wood of the gum-trees. I had
often tried to taste one, but could not manage it. Now,
however, hunger overcame my nausea. It was very
good, but not as I had expected to find it—rich; it was
only sweet and milky.’</p>

<p>Sir Robert Schomburgk writes:—‘The decaying
woods of the West India islands, the Central and some
of the southern portions of America, afford a delicacy
to the Indian, which many colonists do not even refuse,
in the larvæ of a large beetle, which is found in considerable
numbers in the pith, when the trunk is near
its decay. The larva, or grub, is frequently of the size
of the little finger; and, after being boiled or roasted,
resembles in its taste beef marrow. The Indians of
Guiana frequently cut down the Mauritia palm, for the
purpose of attracting the beetle to deposit its eggs in
it, and when they collect a large quantity, they are
roasted over a slow fire, to extract the fat, which is
preserved in calabashes.</p>

<p>The Roman epicures fattened some of these larvæ, or
grubs, on flour. Some naturalists think that the grubs
of most of the beetles might be safely eaten; and that
those of the cockchafer, which feeds upon the roots of
grass, or the perfect insects themselves, which, if we
may judge from the eagerness with which cats, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
turkeys and other birds devour them, are no despicable
morsel, might be added to our food delicacies.
This would certainly be one means of keeping down the
numbers of these occasionally destructive animals.</p>

<p>The Goliath beetles are said to be roasted and eaten
by the natives of South America and Western Africa,
and they often make a <i>bonne bouche</i> of splendid insects
which would gratify many an entomologist. Although
the large prices of £30, £40, or £50, which used to be
asked for them, are now very much reduced, fine specimens
of some of the species even now fetch five to
six pounds for cabinet specimens.</p>

<p>The Australian aborigines are gourmands in their
way, and able to appreciate the good things which
surround them. Mr. Clement Hodgkinson in a work
on Australia says:</p>

<p>‘Bellenger Billy amused me very much by his
curious method of diving to the bottom of the river in
search of cobberra, the large white worms resembling
boiled maccaroni, which abound in immersed wood.
He swam to the centre of the river with a tomahawk
in his hand, and then breathing hard that his lungs
might be collapsed, he rendered his body and tomahawk
specifically heavier than water, and sank feet
foremost to the bottom. After groping about there
for some moments, he emerged on the river’s edge,
with several dead pieces of wood, which he had detached
from the mud. Although I had tasted from
curiosity various kinds of snakes, lizards, guanas,
grubs, and other animals which the blacks feed upon,
I never could muster resolution enough to try one of
these cobberra; although, when I have been engaged
in the survey of salt-water creeks, and I felt hot and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
thirsty, I have often envied the extreme relish with
which some accompanying black could stop and gorge
himself with this moist, living marrow.’</p>

<p>The women of Turkey cook and eat a certain beetle
(<i>Blaps sulcata</i>) in butter to fatten themselves.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c">ORTHOPTERA.</p>

<p>In the next order of insects, the locust tribe, as they
are the greatest destroyers of food, so, as some recompense,
they furnish a considerable supply of it to
numerous nations. They are recorded to have done
this from the most remote antiquity, some Ethiopian
tribes having been named from this circumstance locust-eaters.
The generic name of the locusts, <i>Gryllus</i>, sounds
like an invitation to cook them. Pliny relates that they
were in high esteem as meat amongst the Parthians.
When there is a scarcity of grain, as a substitute for
flour the Arabs grind locusts in their hand-mills, or
pound them in stone mortars. They mix this flour
with water into a dough, and make thin cakes of it,
which they bake like other bread. They also eat them
in another way; they boil them first a good while in
water, and afterwards stew with oil or butter into a
kind of fricassée of no bad flavour.</p>

<p>The large kinds of locust are made use of in several
quarters as food, and in the markets of the Levant
fresh and salted locusts are vended. Hasselquist tells
us, that when corn is scarce, the Arabians grind the
locusts in hand-mills, or pound them in stone mortars,
and bake them as bread; and that even when there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
no scarcity of corn, the Arabs stew them with butter
and make them into a kind of a fricassée, the flavour of
which is by no means disagreeable. Why should land
shrimp sauce not be equal to sea shrimp sauce?</p>

<p>Locusts, Cumming tells us, afford fattening and wholesome
food to man, birds, and all sorts of beasts. The
hungry dogs and hogs feed greedily on them,—so that
there are plenty of enemies to prey in time upon these
wholesale depredators. Young turkeys live almost entirely
on them in some parts of America, and become
very fat when they are plentiful. Hence, if so many
animals thrive upon them, they must necessarily be
dainty food.</p>

<p>It is not only by the inhabitants of the Great Desert
that the locusts are hailed with joy. The Kafirs also
give them a hearty welcome, and make many a good
meal upon them too,—not only eating them in large
quantities, but making a sort of coffee-colored soup of
their eggs.</p>

<p>Locusts are cooked in various ways—roasted, boiled,
and fried. They are also salted and smoked, and
packed away against a time of scarcity. It is said, they
taste very much like fish, and are particularly light,
delicate, and wholesome food. They are carried into
many of the towns of Africa by waggon-loads, as we
bring poultry to market.</p>

<p>The Hottentots are highly rejoiced at the arrival of
the locusts in their country, although they destroy all
its verdure, eating them in such quantities as to get
visibly fatter than before, and making of their eggs a
brown or coffee-coloured soup.</p>

<p>In the Mahratta country in India, the common
people salt and eat them. This was anciently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
custom with many of the African nations, some of whom
also smoked them.</p>

<p>Dishes of locusts are generally served up at the
principal tables in Barbary, and esteemed a great delicacy.
They are preferred by the Moors to pigeons;
and a person may eat a plateful of 200 or 300 without
feeling any ill effects. They usually boil them in water
half-an-hour, having thrown away the head, wings, and
legs, then sprinkle them with salt and pepper and fry
them, adding a little vinegar.</p>

<p>Another traveller describes the way they are prepared
for food in the desert of Zahara.—‘In and about
this valley were great flights of locusts. During the
day, they are flying around very thickly in the atmosphere;
but the copious dews and chilly air in the night
render them unable to fly, and they settle down on the
bushes. It was the constant employment of the natives
in the night to gather these insects from the bushes,
which they did in great quantities. My master’s family,
each with a small bag, went out the first night upon
this employment, carrying a very large bag to bring
home the fruits of their labor. My mistress, Fatima,
however, and the two little children, remained in the
tent. I declined this employment, and retired to rest
under the large tent. The next day, the family returned
loaded with locusts, and, judging by the eye of
the quantity produced, there must have been about
fifteen bushels. This may appear to be a large quantity
to be gathered in so short a time, but it is scarcely
worth mentioning when compared with the loads of them
gathered, sometimes, in the more fertile part of the
country over which they pass, leaving a track of desolation
behind them. But as they were the first, in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
considerable quantity, that I had seen, and the first I
had seen cooked and eaten, I mention it in this place,
hoping hereafter to give my readers more particular
information concerning these wonderful and destructive
insects, which, from the days of Moses to this time,
have been considered, by Jews and Mahometans, as
the most severe judgment which Heaven can inflict
upon man. But, whatever the Egyptians might have
thought in ancient days, or the Moors and Arabs in
those of modern date, the Arabs who are compelled to
inhabit the desert of Zahara, so far from considering a
flight of locusts as a judgment upon them for their
transgressions, welcome their approach as the means,
sometimes, of saving them from famishing with hunger.
The whole that were brought to the tent at this time
were cooked while alive, as indeed they always are, for
a dead locust is never cooked. The manner of cooking
is by digging a deep hole in the ground, building a fire
at the bottom, as before described, and filling it up with
wood. After it is heated as hot as is possible, the coals
and embers are taken out, and they prepare to fill the
cavity with the locusts, confined in a large bag. A
sufficient number of the natives hold the bag perpendicularly
over the hole, the mouth of it being near the
surface of the ground. A number stand round the hole
with sticks. The mouth of the bag is then opened,
and it is shaken with great force, the locusts falling
into the hot pit, and the surrounding natives throwing
sand upon them to prevent them from flying off. The
mouth of the hole is then covered with sand, and
another fire built upon the top of it. In this manner
they cook all they have on hand, and dig a number of
holes sufficient to accomplish it, each containing about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
five bushels. They remain in the hole until they
become sufficiently cooled to be taken out with the
hand. They are then picked out, and thrown upon
tent-cloths or blankets, and remain in the sun to dry,
where they must be watched with the utmost care to
prevent the live locusts from devouring them, if a flight
happens to be passing at the time. When they are
perfectly dried, which is not done short of two or three
days, they are slightly pounded, and pressed into bags
or skins, ready for transportation. To prepare them to
eat, they are pulverized in mortars, and mixed with
water sufficient to make a kind of dry pudding. They
are, however, sometimes eaten singly, without pulverizing,
by breaking off the head, wings, and legs, and
swallowing the remaining part. In whatever manner
they are eaten, they are nourishing food.’</p>

<p>Captain Stockenstrom, in a paper in the <i>South
African Journal</i> on these insects, observes, ‘Not only
the locust-bird, but every animal, domestic and wild,
contributes to the destruction of the locust swarms;
fowls, sheep, horses, dogs, antelopes, and almost every
living thing, may be seen devouring them with equal
greediness; whilst the half-starved Bushmen, and even
some of the colonial Hottentots, consider them a great
luxury, consuming great quantities fresh, and drying
abundance for future emergencies. Great havoc is
also committed among the locusts by their own kindred;
for as soon as any one of them gets hurt, or meets
with an accident which impedes his progress, his fellow
travellers nearest to him immediately turn upon him,
and devour him with great voracity.’</p>

<p>Mr. Moffat (<i>Missionary Labours in South Africa</i>)
states—‘The locusts for food are always caught at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
night, when they are at rest, and carried in sacks to
the nearest encampment or village, to be prepared for
keeping. A very small quantity of water is put into a
pot, and the locusts, piled up to the very brim, are covered
very closely, so that they are rather steamed than
boiled. They are next carefully separated and laid out
to dry, which the heat of an Arabian or African sun
does thoroughly and speedily; after which they are
winnowed to get rid of the wings and legs, when they
are laid up in heaps, or packed in bags of skin for
future use. Sometimes the dry locusts are beaten into
a powder, of which, with water and a little salt, a kind
of pottage is made.’</p>

<p>Mr. R. Gordon Cumming, in the course of his rambles
in Africa, fell in with swarms of locusts, and gives
interesting accounts respecting them. Here are some
extracts from his work:—</p>

<p>‘The next day, as we crossed a vast plain, a flight
of locusts passed over our heads during upwards of
half-an-hour, flying so thick as to darken the sun.
They reached in dark clouds as far as we could see,
and maintained an elevation of from 6 to 300 or 400
feet above the level of the plain. Woe to the vegetation
of the country on which they alight! * *</p>

<p>‘On the march we crossed a swarm of locusts, resting
for the night on the grass and bushes. They lay
so thick that the waggons could have been filled with
them in a very short time, covering the large bushes
just as a swarm of young bees covers the branch on
which it pitches. Locusts afford fattening and wholesome
food to man, birds, and all sorts of beasts; cows
and horses, lions, jackals, hyænas, antelopes, elephants,
&amp;c., devour them. We met a party of Batlapis carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
heavy burdens of them on their backs. Our
hungry dogs made a fine feast on them. The cold
frosty night had rendered them unable to take wing
until the sun should restore their powers. As it was
difficult to obtain sufficient food for my dogs, I and
Isaac took a large blanket, which we spread under a
bush, whose branches were bent to the ground with the
mass of locusts which covered it, and having shaken
the branches, in an instant I had more locusts than I
could carry on my back. These we roasted for ourselves
and dogs. Soon after the sun was up, on looking
behind me, I beheld the locusts stretching to the west
in vast clouds, resembling smoke; but the wind soon
after veering round, brought them back to us, and they
flew over our heads, for some time actually darkening
the sun. * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>‘The dullness of the scene, however, was enlivened
by a wondrous flight of locusts, the largest I had ever
beheld. The prospect was obscured by them as far as
we could see, resembling the smoke arising from a
thousand giant bonfires; while those above our heads
darkened our path with a double flight, the one next
the ground flying north, while the upper clouds of
them held a southerly course. The dogs, as usual,
made a hearty meal of them. * * * *</p>

<p>‘We crossed the Limpopo, and having followed it
for five miles, we at length got into a country so
densely covered with locusts that the spore was no
longer visible. A large herd of elephants had, during
several previous nights, however, been there feasting
upon these insects.’</p>

<p>According to Niebuhr, the Arabians distinguish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
several kinds of locusts, to which they give separate
names. They refer only to the delicacy of its flesh, and
not to the nature of the insect. The red locust is
termed <i>Merrken</i>, as it is esteemed by the epicures
much fatter and more succulent than the light locust,
which is called by them <i>Dubbe</i>, because it has a tendency
to produce diarrhœa. The inhabitants of Arabia,
Persia, Africa, and Syria, are accustomed to eat them.
The Turks have an aversion to this kind of food; but if
the Europeans express the same, the Arabians remind
them of their fondness for crabs, &amp;c. This kind of
food, however, is supposed to thicken the blood, and
produce melancholy.</p>

<p>The custom of feeding upon locusts seems more
generally diffused than is supposed, and is not merely
confined to Africa and Arabia. They are eaten by the
Nanningetes in the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<p>Dampier states that, on islands near Timor, ‘They
make also a dish of locusts, which come at certain
seasons to devour their potatoes. They take them
with nets, and broil or bake them in an earthen pan.
This dish,’ he adds, ‘eats well enough.’</p>

<p>And the author of <i>A Mission to Ava</i> speaks of them
as a Burmese dainty.</p>

<p>‘The most notable viand produced consisted of fried
locusts. These were brought in, hot and hot, in successive
saucers, and I was not sorry to have the
opportunity of tasting a dish so famous. They were
by no means bad, much like what we might suppose
fried shrimps to be. The inside is removed, and the
cavity stuffed with a little spiced meat.’</p>

<p>The Rev. R. Sheppard caused some of our large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
English grasshoppers, or field crickets, to be cooked in
the way here recommended, only substituting butter
for vinegar, and found them to be excellent food.</p>

<p>From these statements it will be seen, that the locusts
which formed part of the sustenance of John the
Baptist, and about which there has been much controversy
among learned men, could be nothing else but
the animal locust, so common a food in the East, and
even in Africa, to the present day. They are eaten
even by the North American Indians.</p>

<p>‘Among the choice delicacies with which the California
Digger Indians regale themselves during the
summer season,’ (says the <i>Empire County Argus</i>,) ‘is
the grasshopper roast. Having been an eye witness to
the preparation and discussion of one of their feasts of
grasshoppers, we can describe it truthfully. There are
districts in California, as well as portions of the plains
between Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains, that
literally swarm with grasshoppers, and in such astonishing
numbers that a man cannot place his foot to
the ground, while walking there, without crushing
great numbers. To the Indian they are a delicacy, and
are caught and cooked in the following manner:—A
piece of ground is sought where they most abound, in
the centre of which an excavation is made, large and
deep enough to prevent the insect from hopping out
when once in. The entire party of diggers, old and
young, male and female, then surround as much of the adjoining
grounds as they can, and each with a green bough
in hand, whipping and thrashing on every side, gradually
approach the centre, driving the insects before
them in countless multitudes, till at last all, or nearly
all, are secured in the pit. In the meantime, smaller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
excavations are made, answering the purpose of ovens,
in which fires are kindled and kept up till the surrounding
earth, for a short distance, becomes sufficiently
heated, together with a flat stone, large enough to cover
the oven. The grasshoppers are now taken in coarse
bags, and after being thoroughly soaked in salt water
for a few moments, are emptied into the oven and
closed in. Ten or fifteen minutes suffice to roast them,
when they are taken out and eaten without further
preparation, and with much apparent relish, or as is
sometimes the case, reduced to powder and made into
soup. And having from curiosity tasted, not of the
soup, but of the roast, really, if one could but divest
himself of the idea of eating an insect, as we do an oyster
or shrimp, without other preparation than simple roasting,
they would not be considered very bad eating,
even by more refined epicures than the Digger Indians.’</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c">NEUROPTERA.</p>

<p>Another order of insects contains the so-called white-ant
tribe (<i>Termes</i>), which, in return for the mischief it
does at certain times, affords an abundant supply of food
to some of the African natives. The natives of Western
Australia pull out the young from the nests at one
season of the year and eat them. Ducks and fowls also
feed greedily on them.</p>

<p>In many countries, the termites, or white-ants, serve
for food. In some parts of the East Indies, the natives
catch the winged insects, just before their period of emigration,
in the following manner:—They make two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
holes, the one to the windward, the other to the leeward;
at the leeward opening, they place the mouth of a
pot, the inside of which has been previously rubbed
with an aromatic herb, called bugera; on the windward
side, they make a fire of stinking materials, which not
only drives these insects, but frequently the hooded
snakes also, into the pots, on which account they are obliged
to be cautious in removing them. By this method,
they catch great quantities, of which they make, with
flour, a variety of pastry, which they can afford to sell
very cheap to the poorer ranks of people. When this
sort of food is used too abundantly, it produces, however,
cholera, which kills in two or three hours. It also
seems that, in some form or other, these insects are
greedily eaten in other districts. Thus, when after
swarming shoals of them fall into the rivers, the Africans
skim them off the surface with calabashes, and,
bringing them to their habitations, parch them in iron
pots over a gentle fire, stirring them about as is usually
done in roasting coffee; in that state, without sauce or
any other addition, they consider them delicious food,
putting them by handfuls into their mouths, as we do
comfits.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>‘I have,’ says Smeathman, ‘eaten them dressed in this
way several times, and think them delicate, nourishing,
and wholesome. They are something sweeter, though
not so fat and clogging, as the caterpillar or maggot of
the palm-tree snout-beetle (<i>Curculio palmarum</i>), which
is served up at all the luxurious tables of the West
Indian epicures, particularly of the French, as the greatest
dainty of the western world.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>Ants are eaten in many countries. In Brazil, the
yellow ant, called cupia, and a larger species under the
name of tama-joura, are much esteemed, being eaten
by the aborigines mixed with resin for sauce. In Africa,
they are stewed with butter. Ants have really no unpleasant
flavour, but are very agreeably acid. In some
parts of Sweden, ants are distilled along with rye, to
give a flavour to the inferior kinds of brandy.</p>

<p>The large saubas (red-ants) and white-ants are an occasional
luxury to the Indians of the Rio Negro; and when
nothing else is to be had in the wet season, they eat
large earth-worms, which, when the lands in which they
live are flooded, ascend trees, and take up their abode in
the hollow leaves of a species of <i>Tillandsia</i>, where they
are often found accumulated by thousands. Nor is it only
hunger that makes them eat these worms, for they sometimes
boil them with their fish to give it an extra relish.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The cocoons of the wood ant (popularly and erroneously
called ants’ eggs) are collected on the Continent
as food for nightingales and larks. A recent
writer tells us, that in most of the towns in Germany
one or more individuals make a living, during summer,
by the business. He describes a visit to an old woman
at Dottendorf, near Bonn, who had collected for fourteen
years. She went to the woods in the morning,
and collected in a bag the surfaces of a number of ant
hills where the cocoons were deposited, taking ants and
all home to her cottage, near which she had a tiled
shed, covering a circular area, hollowed out in the
centre, with a trench full of water around it. After
covering the hollow in the centre with leafy boughs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
walnut or hazel, she strewed the contents of her bag on
the level part of the area within the trench, when the
nurse-ants immediately seized the cocoons and carried
them into the hollow under the boughs. The cocoons
were thus brought into one place, and after being from
time to time removed, and the black ones separated by a
boy, who spread them out on a table and swept off what
were bad with a strong feather, they were ready for
market, being sold for about 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> a quart. Considerable
quantities of these cocoons are dried for winter
food for birds, and are sold in the shops.</p>

<p>Humboldt mentions that he saw insects’ eggs sold in
the markets of Mexico, and which are collected on the
surface of lakes. Under the name of axayacat, these
eggs, or those of some other species of fly, deposited
on rush mats, are sold as a caviare in Mexico. Something
similar, found in the pools of the desert of Fezzan,
serves the Arabs for food, having the taste of caviare.</p>

<p>In the <i>Bulletin de la Société Impériale Zoologique
d’Acclimation</i>, M. Guerin Méneville has published a
very interesting paper on a sort of bread which the
Mexicans make of the eggs of three species of hemipterous
insects.</p>

<p>According to M. Craveri, by whom some of the
Mexican bread, and of the insects yielding it, were
brought to Europe, these insects and their eggs are
very common in the fresh waters of the lagunes of Mexico.
The natives cultivate, in the lagune of Chalco, a
sort of carex called touté, on which the insects readily
deposit their eggs. Numerous bundles of these plants
are made, which are taken to a lagune, the Texcuco,
where they float in great numbers in the water. The
insects soon come and deposit their eggs on the plants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
and in about a month the bundles are removed from the
water, dried, and then beaten over a large cloth to separate
the myriad of eggs with which the insects had
covered them.</p>

<p>These eggs are then cleaned and sifted, put into
sacks like flour, and sold to the people for making a
sort of cake or biscuit called ‘hautlé,’ which forms a
tolerably good food, but has a fishy taste, and is slightly
acid. The bundles of carex are replaced in the lake,
and afford a fresh supply of eggs, which process may
be repeated for an indefinite number of times.</p>

<p>It appears that these insects have been used from
an early period, for Thomas Gage, a religionist, who
sailed to Mexico in 1625, says, in speaking of articles
sold in the markets, that they had cakes made of a sort
of scum collected from the lakes of Mexico, and that this
was also sold in other towns.</p>

<p>Brantz Mayer, in his work on Mexico (<i>Mexico as it
was and as it is</i>, 1844), says,—‘On the lake of Texcuco
I saw men occupied in collecting the eggs of
flies from the surface of plants, and cloths arranged in
long rows as places of resort for the insects. These
eggs, called <i>agayacath</i>’ (Qy. <i>axayacat</i>), ‘formed a favourite
food of the Indians long before the conquest:
and when made into cakes, resembles the roe of a fish,
having a similar taste and appearance. After the use
of frogs in France, and birdsnests in China, I think
these eggs may be considered a delicacy, and I found
that they are not rejected from the tables of the fashionable
inhabitants of the capital.’</p>

<p>The more recent observations of Messrs. Saussure,
Sallé, Virlet D’Aoust, &amp;c., have confirmed the facts
already stated, at least, in the most essential particulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>‘The insects which principally produce this animal farinha
of Mexico, are two species of the genus <i>Corixa</i>
of Geoffroy, hemipterous insects of the family of water-bugs.
One of the species has been described by M.
Guerin Méneville as new, and has been named by him
<i>Corixa fermorata</i>: the other, identified in 1831 by
Thomas Say as one of those sold in the market at
Mexico, bears the name of <i>Corixa mercenaria</i>. The
eggs of these two species are attached in innumerable
quantities to the triangular leaves of the carex forming
the bundles which are deposited in the waters. They
are of an oval form with a protuberance at one end
and a pedicle at the other extremity, by means of which
they are fixed to a small round disc, which the mother
cements to the leaf. Among these eggs, which are
grouped closely together, and sometimes fixed one over
another, there are found others, which are larger, of a
long and cylindrical form, and which are fixed to the
same leaves. These belong to another larger insect, a
species of <i>Notonecta</i>, which M. Guerin Méneville has
named <i>Notonecta unifasciata</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>It appears from M. Virlet d’Aoust, that in October
the lakes Chalco and Texcuco, which border on the city
of Mexico, are haunted by millions of small flies, which,
after dancing in the air, plunge down into the shallowest
parts of the water, to the depth of several feet, and deposit
their eggs at the bottom.</p>

<p>‘The eggs of these insects are called hautle (haoutle),
by the Mexican Indians, who collect them in great numbers,
and with whom they appear to be a favourite
article of food.</p>

<p>‘They are prepared in various ways, but usually made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
into cakes, which are eaten with a sauce flavoured with
chillies. To collect the eggs the Indians prepare bundles
of rushes, which they place vertically in the lake
at some distance from the shore. In about a fortnight,
every rush in these bundles is completely covered with
eggs. The bundles are then drawn out and dried in
the sun upon a cloth for not more than an hour, when
the eggs are easily detached. The bundles of rushes
are then placed in the water again for another crop.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Ruschenberger, the surgeon to the American
expedition to Siam, in describing a state feast given to
the officers, states that the dinner was remarkable for
the variety and exquisite flavour of the curries. Among
them was one consisting of ants’ eggs, a costly and
much esteemed luxury of Siam. They are not larger
than grains of sand, and to a palate unaccustomed to
them, are not particularly savory. They are almost
tasteless. Besides being curried, they are brought to
the table rolled in green leaves, mingled with shreds or
very fine slices of fat pork. Here was seen an ever-to-be-remembered
luxury of the East.</p>

<p>It would hardly be suspected that bees serve for food
in Ceylon and some other places,—an ungrateful return
for their honey and wax.</p>

<p>The African Bushmen eat the caterpillars of the butterflies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>The Chinese, who waste nothing, after they have unwound
the silk from the cocoons of the silk-worm,
send the chrysalis to table. They also eat the larvæ of
a hawk-moth, some of which tribe, Dr. Darwin tells us,
are, in his opinion, very delicious. The natives of New
Holland eat the caterpillars of a species of moth, and
also a kind of butterfly, which they call <i>bugong</i>, which
congregate in certain districts, at particular seasons, in
countless myriads. On these occasions, the native blacks
assemble from far and near to collect them; and after removing
the wings and down, by stirring them on the
ground, previously heated by a large fire, winnowing
them, eat the bodies, or store them up for use, by pounding
and smoking them. The bodies of these butterflies
abound in an oil, with the taste of nuts; when first eaten,
they produce violent vomitings and other debilitating
effects; but these go off after a few days, and the natives
then thrive and fatten exceedingly on this diet, for which
they have to contend with a black crow, which is also
attracted by the butterflies, and which they dispatch with
their clubs, and use as food.</p>

<p>Two insects, a kind of butterfly, and a thick, white
grub, found chiefly in dead timber, are much esteemed
by the aborigines of Australia as articles of food. The
former is eaten at certain seasons by whole tribes of
natives in the northern districts. Their practice is to
follow up the flight of the insects, and to light fires at
night-fall beneath the trees in which they have roosted.
The smoke brings the butterflies down, and their bodies
are pounded together into a sort of fleshy loaf. Upon
this delicacy the natives not only feed, but fatten. The
white grub is swallowed whole in his living state, and
is much sought for by sable epicures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>In India, and in South America, these grubs are also
eaten as a dainty.</p>

<p>The trunk of the grass-tree, or black-boy (<i>Xanthorea
arborea</i>), when beginning to decay, furnishes large quantities
of marrow-like grubs, which are considered a delicacy
by the aborigines in Western Australia. They
have a fragrant, aromatic flavour, and form a favourite
food among the natives, either raw or roasted. They
call them <i>bardi</i>—and they are also found in the wattle
tree, or mimosa. The presence of these grubs in a
<i>xanthorea</i> is thus ascertained: if the top of one of these
trees is observed to be dead, and it contain any bardi,
a few sharp kicks given to it with the foot will cause it
to crack and shake, when it is pushed over and the grub
extracted, by breaking the tree to pieces with a hammer.
The bardi of the <i>xanthorea</i> are small, and found together
in great numbers; those of the wattle are cream
coloured, as long and thick as a man’s finger, and are
found singly. The excrement of the latter oozes from
under the bark, of the appearance and consistence of
clear gum. The galls formed on several species of sage
by gall flies, in the Levant, are highly prized for
their aromatic and acid flavour, especially when prepared
with sugar. They constitute, in fact, a considerable
article of commerce from Scio to Constantinople, where
they are regularly sold in the market. They are
known as sage apples, and in Greece are made into a
kind of conserve, which is highly esteemed.</p>

<p>Coming to another order of insects, the cicada, or
chirping flies, we find that these were eaten by the
polished Greeks, and accounted very delicious. They
were caught, strung, sold, and greedily devoured; and
especially the females were relished on account of their
white eggs. One species, a very long-lived one, which,
if spared, lives to the age of 17 years, is still eaten by
the Indians of America, who pluck off the wings and
boil them. The aborigines of Australia eat them raw,
after stripping off the wings.</p>

<p>The 17-year locusts, while in an underground grub
state, are a favourite food of various species of animals.
Immense numbers are destroyed by hogs before they
emerge from the ground; they are also, when in their
perfect state, eagerly devoured by chickens, squirrels,
and many of the larger birds. The Indians likewise
consider them a delicate food when fried; and in New
Jersey they have been turned to a profitable account in
making soap.</p>

<p>No insects are more numerous with us than caterpillars,
and sad havoc they occasionally commit among
our cabbages and cauliflowers. Now we generally make
wry faces, when a stray one is served up with our
greens, and the cook is severely taken to task; but
these are reckoned among the chief delicacies of an
African Bushman’s meal.</p>

<p>The Hottentots eat them boiled and raw, and soon
get into good condition on this food. They bring large
calabashes full of them to their habitations, and parch
them in iron pots over a gentle fire, stirring them about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
as is done in roasting coffee. In that state, without
sauce or other addition, they serve them up as delicious
food, and eat them by handfuls, as we do sugar-plums.</p>

<p>One traveller tells us he has eaten them dressed in
this way several times, and thought them delicate, nourishing,
and wholesome, being sweeter than the grub of
the weevil of the palm, and resembling in taste sugared
cream or sweet almond paste.</p>

<p>What will be said to spiders as food? But these form
an article in the list of the Bushman’s dainties in South
Africa, according to Sparrman; and the inhabitants of
New Caledonia, Labillardiere tells us, seek for, and eat
with avidity, large quantities of a spider nearly an
inch long, which they roast over the fire. Even individuals
amongst the more polished nations of Europe
are recorded as having a similar taste; so that if you
could rise above vulgar prejudices, you would in all
probability find them a most delicate morsel. If you
require precedents, Reaumur tells us of a young lady,
who, when she walked in her grounds, never saw a
spider that she did not take and crunch upon the spot.
Another female, the celebrated Anna Maria Schurman,
used to eat them like nuts, which she affirmed they
much resembled in taste, excusing her propensity by
saying that she was born under the sign <i>Scorpio</i>.</p>

<p>If you wish for the authority of the learned: Lalande,
the celebrated French astronomer, was equally
fond of these delicacies, according to Latreille. And if,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
not content with eating spiders seriatim, you should
feel desirous of eating them by handfuls, you may
shelter yourself under the authority of the German immortalized
by Rosel, who used to spread them upon bread
like butter, observing that he found them very useful.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>These edible spiders, and such like, are all sufficiently
disgusting, but we feel our nausea quite turned into
horror when we read in Humboldt, that he has seen the
Indian children drag out of the earth centipedes 18
inches long, and more than half an inch broad, and
devour them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c11">CRUSTACEA.</h2>
</div>


<p>The flesh of all crustaceous animals, although in great
request, is rather difficult of digestion; and much of it
cannot be eaten with impunity. There are classes of
persons who are as averse to use shell-fish for food,
as a Mahommedan or Mussulman are to partake of
pork. It is therefore curious to reflect how, and where,
the thousands of tons of crustacea and shell-fish taken
to Billingsgate and Hungerford markets are disposed of.
Lobsters, cray-fish, prawns, shrimps, oysters, mussels,
periwinkles, and whelks, are there every morning in
great abundance, and the high retail prices they fetch,
show that this description of food must be well relished
by the Londoners.</p>

<p>The land crabs of the West Indies are an esteemed
delicacy, and the ravenous pigs feed on them with
equal avidity to the great danger of their health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>I need not here advert to the migratory habits of
the crabs, to their uniting at certain periods in vast
numbers, and moving in the most direct course to the
sea, marching in squadrons and lines, and halting twice
a-day for feeding and repose. These movements may
often be seen in Jamaica, and other West Indian
islands, where millions on millions string themselves
along the coast on progresses from the hills to the sea,
and from the sea to the hills.</p>

<p>The reader of Bishop Heber’s <i>Indian Journal</i> will
remember his account of the land crabs at Poonah.
‘All the grass land generally through the Deckan
swarms with a small land crab, which burrows in the
ground, and runs with considerable swiftness, even
when encumbered with a bundle of food almost as big
as itself. This food is grass or the green stalks of rice;
and it is amusing to see them sitting as it were upright,
to cut their hay with their sharp pincers, then
waddling off with the sheaf to their holes as quietly as
their side-long pace will carry them.’</p>

<p>This is not the same land crab of which we are
speaking, but it is a graphic picture of the <i>Gecarcina
ruricola</i>, in its habit of feeding.</p>

<p>They cut up roots and leaves, and feed on the fallen
fruit of trees; but we have little more than conjecture
for the cause of their occasional deleterious qualities.
Impressed with the notion that the crabs owe their
hurtful qualities to the fruit of the manchineel tree, Sloane
imagined that he had explained the fatal accidents
which have occurred to some persons after eating them,
from neglect, or inattentiveness to precaution in cleaning
their interior and removing the half digested particles
of the fruit. It has been ascertained that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
feed on such dangerous vegetables of the morass as the
<i>Anona palustris</i>, a fruit exceedingly narcotic. It is
well enough known that the morass crab is always to
be suspected. The land crabs, however, collect leaves
less for food than to envelop themselves in, when they
moult. After concealment for a time within their
burrows, they come forth in those thin teguments forming
a red tense pellicle, similar to wet parchment, and
are more delicate in that condition, and more prized for
the table. The white crabs are the most bulky of the
tribe, and are the least esteemed, and the most mistrusted.</p>

<p>Land-crabs, says a Jamaica paper, of March last, are
to be seen on the highways between this, Montego Bay,
and Gum Island, just like bands of soldiers, marching
to a battle-point of concentration. This bids fair to
supply the epicure, at an easy rate, with this class of
crustacea. It is one of the most remarkable, for it is
composed of animals breathing by means of branchiæ
or gills, and yet essentially terrestrial; so much so, indeed,
that they would perish from asphyxia if submerged
for any length of time.</p>

<p>I select Browne’s account of the habits of the black
or mountain crab, because he resided many years in
Jamaica, and seems to have lost no opportunity of making
personal observations; and his remarks tally with
my own experience, from three years’ residence in
Jamaica.</p>

<p>‘These creatures are very numerous in some parts of
Jamaica, as well as in the neighbouring islands, and on
the coast of the main continent; they are generally of
a dark purple colour, but this often varies, and you frequently
find them spotted, or entirely of another hue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
They live chiefly on dry land, and at a considerable
distance from the sea, which, however, they visit once a
year to wash off their spawn, and afterwards return to
the woods and higher lands, where they continue for
the remaining part of the season; nor do the young
ones ever fail to follow them, as soon as they are able to
crawl. The old crabs generally regain their habitations
in the mountains, which are seldom within less than a
mile, and not often above three from the shore, by the
latter end of June, and then provide themselves with
convenient burrows, in which they pass the greatest part
of the day, going out only at night to feed. In December
and January they begin to be in spawn, and are then
very fat and delicate, but continue to grow richer until
the month of May, which is the season for them to wash
off their eggs. They begin to move down in February,
and are very much abroad in March and April, which
seems to be the time for the impregnation of their eggs,
being then frequently found fixed together; but the
males, about this time, begin to lose their flavour and richness
of their juices. The eggs are discharged from the body
through two small round holes situated at the sides, and
about the middle of the under shell; these are only large
enough to admit one at a time, and as they pass they
are entangled in the branched capillaments, with which
the under side of the apron is copiously supplied, to
which they stick by the means of their proper gluten,
until the creatures reach the surf, where they wash them
all off, and then they begin to return back again to the
mountains. It is remarkable that the bag or stomach of
this creature changes its juices with the state of the body;
and while poor is full of a black, bitter, disagreeable
fluid, which diminishes as it fattens, and at length acquires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
a delicate, rich flavour. About the month of
July or August, the crabs fatten again and prepare for
moulting, filling up their burrows with dry grass,
leaves, and abundance of other materials: when the
proper period comes, each retires to his hole, shuts up
the passage, and remains quite inactive until he gets rid
of his old shell, and is fully provided with a new one.
How long they continue in this state is uncertain, but
the shell is observed to burst, both at the back and sides,
to give a passage to the body, and it extracts its limbs
from all the other parts gradually afterwards. At this
time, the fish is in the richest state, and covered only
with a tender membraneous skin, variegated with a multitude
of reddish veins; but this hardens gradually after,
and becomes soon a perfect shell like the former; it is,
however, remarkable, that during this change, there are
some stony concretions always formed in the bag, which
waste and dissolve gradually, as the creature forms and
perfects its new crust. A wonderful mechanism! This
crab runs very fast, and always endeavours to get into
some hole or crevice on the approach of danger; nor
does it wholly depend on its art and swiftness, for while
it retreats it keeps both claws expanded, ready to catch
the offender if he should come within its reach; and if
it succeeds on these occasions, it commonly throws off
the claw, which continues to squeeze with incredible
force for near a minute after; while he, regardless of the
loss, endeavours to make his escape, and to gain a more
secure or a more lonely covert, contented to renew his
limb with his coat at the ensuing change; nor would it
grudge to lose many of the others to preserve the trunk
entire, though each comes off with more labour and
reluctance, as their numbers lessen.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>There are several varieties of land crabs, such as
the large white, the mulatto, the black, and the red.
The black and red crabs are most excellent eating:
when in season, the females are full of a rich glutinous
substance, called the eggs, which is perfectly
delicious. Epicurean planters, in some of the West
Indian Islands, have crab pens, (after the manner of
fowl coops,) for fattening these luxuries. The best
manner of dressing them is to pick out all the flesh
from the shell, making it into a stew, with plenty
of cayenne pepper, dishing it up in the shell; in this
way they are little inferior to turtle. They are usually
simply boiled, or roasted in the embers, by which they
are deprived of their luscious flavour, and become not
only insipid in taste but disgusting to look at.</p>

<p>In Dominica, they form an ingredient in the well-known
‘pepper-pot.’ The black crabs are also picked
from their shell, stewed with Indian kale and pods of
chilhies, and eaten with a pudding made of maize flour
or rice; this dish is greatly esteemed by most of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the islands and cays of the Bahamas group, land
crabs literally swarm, and afford food for the inhabitants
the greatest part of the year: even the hogs are
fed upon them. It is the grey or white kind of crab,
common to Cuba and the Bahamas. In the autumn
they are very fat, and equal in flavour to the black
species of Jamaica. They are found in myriads in all
parts, and thought a great delicacy; but a stranger
tires of them in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The black crab is very fat and delicious; but the
white and the mulatto crabs are sometimes dangerous,
from feeding upon poisonous leaves and berries. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
prevent any evil consequences, the flesh is washed with
lime-juice and water.</p>

<p>Land crabs were probably plentiful in Italy, in
the time of Virgil, for in his <i>Fourth Georgic</i> he forbids
the roasting of red crabs near an apiary, the smell of
them being disagreeable to the bees.</p>

<p>There is a species of fresh-water crab, the mason
(<i>Cancer cementarius</i>), met with in Chile, the flesh of
which is very white, and represented to be preferable
to that of any other species of fluvial or marine crab.
It is about eight inches long, of a brown colour, striped
with red. They are found in abundance in almost all
the rivers and brooks, on whose shores they build
themselves, with clay, a small cylindrical tenement
which rises six inches above the surface of the ground,
but admits the water, by means of a subterranean
canal extending to the bed of the river. They are
easily caught, by letting down into the water a basket,
or osier-pot, with a piece of meat in it.</p>

<p>That well-known crustacean, or ‘shell-fish’ as it is
popularly termed,—the lobster (<i>Astacus gammarus</i>),
although it is no fish at all, is found in great plenty
about most of the European and American shores,
and greatly esteemed as a very rich and nourishing
aliment. In this country lobsters are considered in
season from November till the end of April. They
are not allowed to be caught on the coasts of Scotland
between the 1st of June and the 1st of September,
under a penalty of £5. Lobsters must not be offered
for sale in this country under eight inches in length.
Like the crab, the lobster casts its shell annually. It
begins to breed in the spring, and continues breeding
during the greater part of the summer. Lobsters are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
occasionally caught on the shores and in the neighbourhood
of rocks, which they frequent, by the hand; but
they are usually trapped in baskets, or pots made of
osier-twigs, which are baited with garbage, and thrown
into the sea, the situation being marked by a buoy
of cork.</p>

<p>Lobsters are very abundant about Scilly and the
Land’s End, and near Montrose in Scotland. In the
Orkney and Shetland Islands, the value of the lobsters
caught in 1833 was £1,800, which gave employment to
216 boats, and about 500 men. They are sent principally
to Leith. Those caught near Heligoland are esteemed
the most delicate. The largest fishery for these
crustaceans is on the coasts of Norway, from whence we
import more than a million a year. Upwards of half-a-million
are caught on the shores of Scotland and Ireland.
Lobsters are found almost everywhere on the North
American coasts, and in the Bay of Chaleur, in such
extraordinary numbers, that they are used by thousands
to manure the land.</p>

<p>Mr. Perley, in his <i>Report on the Sea and River
Fisheries of New Brunswick</i>, states, ‘That at Shippagan
and Caraquette, carts are sometimes driven down
to the beaches at low water, and readily filled with lobsters
left in the shallow pools by the recession of the
tide. Every potato field near the places mentioned is
strewn with lobster shells, each potato hill being furnished
with two or three lobsters.</p>

<p>‘Within a few years,’ he adds, ‘one establishment has
been set up on Portage Island, at the mouth of the
River Miramachi, and another at the mouth of the
Kouchibouguac River, for putting up lobsters, in tin
cases, hermetically sealed for exportation. In 1845, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
less than 13,000 cases of lobsters and salmon were
thus put up at Portage Island. In 1847, nearly
10,000 cases of lobsters, each case containing the
choicest parts of two or three lobsters, and one-and-a-half
tons of fresh salmon in 2-lb. and 4-lb. cases,
were put up at Kouchibouguac. The preservation of
lobsters in this manner need only be restricted by the
demand, for the supply is unlimited. The price paid
for lobsters, at the establishment on Portage Island, is
2<i>s.</i> per 100. They are all taken in small hoop nets,
chiefly by the Acadian French of the Neguac villages,
who, at the price stated, could with reasonable diligence,
make £1 each in the 24 hours; but as they are
somewhat idle and easily contented, they rarely exert
themselves to earn more than 10<i>s.</i> per day, which they
can generally obtain by eight or ten hours’ attention to
their hoop nets.</p>

<p>‘In 1848, about 4,000 lbs. of lobsters were put up at
Portage Island in 1-lb. or 2-lb. tin cases. The quantity
preserved was much less than usual, owing to the
prevalence of cholera in the United States, and the consequent
want of a market there. One Frenchman had,
unassisted, caught 1,200 lobsters in part of one day.
About 25 men are employed at this preserving establishment
during the season.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Woolner has a small but very complete establishment
for preserving lobsters, at Petit Rocher, in the Bay
of Chaleur. In the season of 1849, he only put up a
small quantity, 2,000 lbs., in tins. He purchases from
the settlers the white part of the lobsters, boiled and
free from shell, at 2<i>d.</i> per lb., which is salted in plain
pickle, and packed in barrels, for sale at Quebec. He
shipped last year 11,000 lbs. of salted lobsters.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>Next to timber, lobsters form one of the greatest
articles of Norwegian export. On the rocky shores of
Christiansand, they are found in greater numbers than
in any other part of the world; and from Bergen,
which lies farther to the north, as many as 260,000
pairs have been exported in one year. Mr. J. E.
Saunders, of Billingsgate, into whose hands almost the
entire trade of these crustaceans has fallen, often sells
15,000 lobsters before breakfast of a morning; and in
the height of the season, the sale not unfrequently
amounts to 30,000. They are sent in great numbers
from Scotland to the markets of London, Liverpool,
and Birmingham—60 or 70 large boxes of them being
transmitted at a time by train. Our fishermen, it is
true, take them occasionally in pots round the coast,
but no systematic fishery is carried on for them.</p>

<p>A company was recently formed at Berwick to import
them alive, in welled smacks, from the coast of
Norway. They are also brought into Southampton
from Brittany and Ireland in welled smacks, which
carry from 7,000 to 8,000 each.</p>

<p>‘Lobster-carrying is subject to the following contingencies:—Thunder
kills them when in the well; also proximity
to the discharge of heavy ordnance. Mr. Scovell
lost several thousand from the latter cause, one of his
smacks having anchored at night too near the saluting-battery
at Plymouth. Calms also destroy the lobsters
in the well, but onward or pitching motion in a seaway
does not affect them. They keep alive one month in
the well without food.’<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>An artificial pond, or saltern, has been formed at
Hamble, in the Southampton water, for keeping lobsters
alive in. It is about 50 yards square, by 10 to 12 feet
deep, with shelving sides of brick or stone and cement, and
a concrete bottom, having a lock or weir at the entrance,
for the admission and exit of salt water at the bottom
(the Hamble being a fresh-water stream). This pond
cost about £13,000. The lobsters are fed on fish, and
fatten. Sometimes there are as many as 70,000 lobsters
in this pond. All weak lobsters are kept in baskets
and sold first. Even here, however, their cannibal-like
propensities are not extinguished; for the powerful
make war upon, and incorporate into their own natures,
the weak. There are feeders and keepers employed at
the saltern, who, with long poles, hooked at the end,
drag out the fish as they are wanted for the market
from their marine menagerie. The instant the pole
touches a fish, the latter grasps it savagely with its
claws, and does not loose its hold until it is on <i>terra
firma</i>. When large quantities are required, the pond
is drained. These shell-fish are enormous creatures,
the body with the claws being as long as a man’s arm.
As the lobsters and cray-fish climb nimbly up the sides
of the watery caravan, they look like a collection of
purple-coloured monkeys or stunted baboons; and there
is something frightful in the appearance and noiselessness
of these chatterless simiæ, climbing about their
liquid den, and approaching the surface to look at the
spectator. They are sent to the metropolis in hampers,
packed in fern in winter and in ice in summer.</p>

<p>The Americans in the large cities and inland towns
seem to be as fond of lobster salads and curries as we
Britishers are; and it is estimated, that there are annually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
consumed in and about Boston, 700,000 lobsters,
the prime cost of which is £16 per 1,000. This makes
the snug little sum of £11,200. 500,000 of the lobsters
come from the State of Maine, and the remaining
200,000 are taken from Massachusetts Bay. About
700 men are engaged in catching the lobsters, and some
800 tons of shipping in carrying them to Boston, exclusive
of what are conveyed by steamboat and railroad.</p>

<p>Here is a poetical narrative, of American origin,
bearing upon this crustacean:—</p>

<p>Lord Anson mentions having caught cray-fish at
Juan Fernandez of eight and nine lbs. weight, that
were of an excellent flavour. Lobsters are also found
in such quantities on the same island, that the fishermen
have no other trouble to take them than to strew
a little meat upon the shore, and when they come to
devour the bait, as they do in immense numbers, to
turn them on their backs with a stick. This is gravely
asserted by the Abbé Molina, in his <i>History of Chile</i>,
so I suppose it must be true. Turning a turtle is a
common practice, but I should think it somewhat difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
to get a lobster on its back. By this simple method
thousands of lobsters are taken annually; and the tails,
which are in high estimation, dried and sent to
Valparaiso.</p>

<p>A late traveller, in his <i>Life in China</i>, describes a
very peculiar dish:—‘When our party of six had
seated themselves at the centre table, my attention,’ he
says, ‘was attracted by a <i>covered</i> dish, something unusual
at a Chinese meal. On a certain signal, the cover
was removed; and presently the face of the table was
covered with juvenile crabs, which made their exodus
from the dish with all possible rapidity. The crablets
had been thrown into a plate of vinegar just as the
company sat down—such an immersion making them
more brisk and lively than usual. But the sprightly
sport of the infant crabs was soon checked, by each
guest seizing which he could, dashing it into his mouth,
crushing it between his teeth, and swallowing the whole
morsel without ceremony. Determined to do as the Chinese
did, I tried this novelty also with one—with two. I
succeeded, finding the shell soft and gelatinous, for they
were tiny creatures, not more than a day or two old.
But I was compelled to give in to the third, which had
resolved to take vengeance, and gave my lower lip a
nip so sharp and severe, as to make me relinquish my
hold, and likewise desist from any further experiments
of this nature.’</p>

<p>Shrimps (<i>Crangon vulgaris</i>) and prawns (<i>Palæmon
serratus</i>) frequent shallow waters along the sandy coasts
of the British Islands, of America, Europe, and indeed most
countries. Besides furnishing nutriment to great numbers
of fish, aquatic birds, &amp;c., they are in great request
in England for the table—the consumption in London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
alone being enormous. In 1850, 192,295 gallons were
received and sold at Billingsgate Market, weighing
875 tons, and valued at £6,000. In the Sandwich Islands,
shrimps are eaten alive as a <i>bonne bouche</i>, with
salad and vinegar; but we prefer them in this country
boiled. Shrimping by the dredge net, or sweep net,
affords abundant employment to numerous persons.
On the North American coasts shrimps are more plentiful
than on the European shores. At times, the waters of
the Straits of Northumberland appear as if thickened
with masses of shrimps moving about, their course being
plainly indicated by the fish of all descriptions which
follow in their wake, and feed upon them greedily.
Potted shrimps are considered a dainty, and meet ready
sale in the metropolis as a breakfast relish.</p>

<p>Those <i>bons vivants</i> who are fond of these delicious
small fry, will no doubt eat them with an increased relish
after reading the following paragraph:—</p>

<p>‘The office of shrimps seems to be that analogous to
some of the insects on land, whose task is to clear away
the remains of dead animal matter after the beasts and
birds of prey have been satiated. If a dead small bird
or frog be placed where ants can have access to it,
those insects will speedily reduce the body to a closely
cleared skeleton. The shrimp family, acting in hosts, as
speedily remove all traces of fish or flesh from the
bones of any dead animal exposed to their ravages.
They are, in short, the principal scavengers of the
ocean; and, notwithstanding their office, they are highly
prized as nutritious and delicious food.’</p>

<p>‘Amongst the shell-fish tribe,’ says a writer in the
<i>Caledonian Mercury</i>, ‘the <i>prawn</i> is considered the
most delicious, and of course is the most costly. Prawn-fish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
which are about double or three times the size of
a shrimp, are in general sold at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> per
dozen. This high price may be owing to their scarcity,
in comparison with the quantity of shrimps sent to
market, with a view to give prawn-fishers encouragement
to prosecute the trade. The prawn-fish are not
what many people suppose, ‘only shrimps of a larger
size.’ Their heads and fore-claws are differently marked,
showing at once the distinction. The habits of the
two fish are also different. The shrimp burrows in the
sand, causing fishermen to use trawl-nets for their capture.
They are caught in greatest numbers on sandbanks,
about the entrance of estuaries. The prawn-fish
chiefly locate amongst rocks, and hard bottom, where
there is much tangle and sea-weed. The fishermen at
Bognor, in Sussex, and some place on the Isle of
Wight, catch prawns in wicker-worked baskets, shaped
exactly like those wire-worked rat-traps that have the
entrance on the top, so that ‘when the rat gets in, it
can’t get out again.’ Several hundreds of these baskets
baited with any sort of garbage, fish heads, &amp;c., are
set amongst the rocks at low water, where they remain
until the tide has flown to its full, and again ebbed.
The baskets are then overhauled, to see what luck.
Prawn-fishing, like every other description of fishing, is
not always to be depended on. Some tides, not one
prawn may be found in hundreds of baskets; at other
times every trap may have secured its victims. From
five up to 60, and as high as 70 prawns have at times
been taken in one trap. The baskets with which the
English fishermen catch lobsters are just of the same
shape as the prawn-trap, the only difference being that
they are of larger dimensions.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>Immense prawns (<i>Camaroes</i>) are very plentiful at Rio
Janeiro. Strangers are often told as a joke, that these
are kept in pits, and fed with the dead bodies of slaves,
thrown to them from time to time, and many people
will in consequence not touch them.</p>

<p>The following instructions for cooking shrimps and
prawns may be acceptable in out-of-the-way localities,
where they are bought alive from the fishermen:—</p>

<p>‘To dress shrimps and prawns, so that they might
at once be tasty and look well to the eye, is considered
a very nice point for the cook to perform. A pot, containing
a pickle that will nearly float an egg, is put
on the fire. When the pickle begins to boil, the prawns
(all alive) are put into it, which of course sends the
pickle below the boiling point for a time. A brisk fire
must be kept up under the pot, and when the pickle
again boils up, the prawns are cooked. Should they
not be boiled sufficiently, they are as soft as pulp, and if
boiled too much, they are hard as horn. The fish are
removed from the pot and spread on a table, sprinkling
over them a little salt. A cloth is then thrown over the
whole, which keeps in the steam. By this operation,
the steam melts the salt, and imparts to the prawn that
beautiful red and glossy appearance seen on them whilst
in the London fishmongers’ shops.’</p>

<p>It might probably be possible to save some of our
refuse shrimps, which get too stale to find customers
here, and dry them for export to the East, where they
are in great demand. The trade in dried shrimps in
Siam amounts to 60 tons a year; and they cannot get
enough of them to pound up with their rice.</p>

<p>Dried prawns form a considerable article of trade in
the Philippines. The Malays and the Siamese, who eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
dried prawns and dried mussels, must have very tough
stomachs to digest them, and it would take an ostrich’s
gizzard, one would suppose, to triturate other tough
dried molluscs used, in different localities, such as the
<i>Haliotis</i> dried. Thus the ‘pearl womb,’ as the mantle
or flesh of the pearl-oyster (<i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i>)
is called, is strung and dried, and when cooked
with cassia buds is eaten with rice. Numerous
minute pearls are often found in this substance (as
is sometimes the case with the common oyster) during
mastication.</p>

<p>There is scope enough to be found for drying this
mollusc, when a government pearl fishery is on at
Ceylon, for then millions of pearl-oysters are thrown
on the shore, after being opened, and left there to rot.</p>

<p>Under the name of <i>Balachong</i> or <i>gnapee</i>, there is a
mess made in Burmah, Sumatra, &amp;c., of prawns, shrimps,
or any cheap fish, pounded into a consistent mass, and
frequently allowed to become partially putrid. It is
largely used by the natives as a condiment to their rice,
as no vegetable food is deemed palatable without it; and
a considerable trade is carried on with it, its use extending
to every country from China to Bengal.</p>

<p>In all populous cities there is great consumption of
oysters, both of the large common kinds termed ‘scuttlemouths’
by the venders, and of the more expensive
and small delicate fed ‘native.’ Even the mangrove or
tree oyster is esteemed in the tropics. One hundred or
two hundred of these parasitic oysters may often be
found on a single bough, pendent in the water, in the
rivers of Africa, or the West Indies.</p>

<p>We can well conceive the astonishment of Columbus
and his mariners when, in the Gulf of Paria, they first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
found oysters clinging to the branches, their mouths
open as was supposed, to receive the dew, which was
afterwards to be transformed into pearls.</p>

<p>The spawn of the fish is attached by a glutinous
substance to any object with which it comes in contact,
and the adhesion continues until the oyster is forcibly
removed. On the southern coasts of the United
States, in Florida and Louisiana, oysters may thus be
seen growing as it were on trees, or the limbs at least of
those which have sunk into the water, by the weight of
the foliage, or from any other cause. The opossum and
the racoon feed upon these oysters, procuring them by
lifting the boughs from the water, and hence the American
name racoon oysters, a term they are universally known
by. They are of a long slender shape, and growing very
rapidly, always have thin and delicate shells.</p>

<p>The value of the oysters sold in the city of New
York now exceeds £1,250,000 sterling. The money
invested in the trade by 150 wholesale dealers is about
£100,000, and the number of persons employed in the
business, directly or indirectly, including saloon keepers,
street venders, &amp;c., is 50,000. Of the whole amount
sold in the markets, about two-thirds come from Virginia,
which has a more extensive oyster trade than any other
State in the Union. The residue is obtained, according
to the <i>New York Herald</i>, from the waters of their own
State, and those of New Jersey—the East River furnishing
the largest quantity. A considerable supply is
procured from Shrewsbury and York Bay; but very
few of the latter are consumed in the city, as they are
cultivated particularly for the western market. One of
the most interesting features in the business is the
transplanting of oysters, or their removal from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
‘rock,’ or natural bed, to an artificial one. This process
is of peculiar importance, and absolutely necessary
to the successful prosecution of the trade. It would,
in fact, be next to impossible to supply the market
during the whole year, but for the general system
of transplanting which is pursued by all the dealers.
More than a million dollars’ worth are removed every
year to artificial beds, and by this means prevented
from spawning, which renders them unfit for use.
Thus, a large proportion of the East River oysters were
originally obtained from the North River, where the
soil and water are not considered so favourable to their
cultivation. Of the fifty thousand persons engaged in
the business, the majority, of course, are dependent
upon their own labour for support; but there are
a considerable number of the dealers, or, as they might
more properly be called, oyster merchants, who possess
large fortunes, amassed from the sale of oysters alone.
They are amongst the most worthy of her citizens, and
New York is not a little indebted to their enterprise for
her extensive business in what has now become an indispensable
article of food.</p>

<p>It is only within the last thirty years that the oyster
trade was established in New York. Before that time,
it is true, oysters were sold there; but the business
transacted was exceedingly limited, and there was little
or no inducement for persons to engage in it. Nearly
all that were brought to market were procured from the
natural beds, for the benefits to be obtained from planting
were but imperfectly understood by a few of the
dealers, or entirely unknown to them. In the course
of a few years, however, the business grew into importance,
and men of capital and enterprise engaged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
it. The planting of beds—a very essential part of the
trade—was commenced; the few oyster boats, of
diminutive size, engaged in supplying New York,
became an immense fleet; an extensive trade began
with Virginia; the East River became a mine of wealth
to those who worked its beds; the coasts of the bays
and the shores of the rivers were explored and given
over to the tongs, the scraper, and the dredges of the
oystermen. It was found that by removing the oyster
from its natural bed to an artificial one, it could not
only be increased in size, but improved in quality, and
rendered fit for use at any period of the year. This
was a very important matter to understand, for there
are certain months when the oyster is unfit for use, in
consequence of its being full of spawn. While they remained
in the natural bed, they were always subject to
this objection; but if not permitted to lie too long in
the artificial one, they could be preserved free from
spawn. Although they increased in size, they seldom
or never became more numerous by transplanting.
Hundreds of vessels are constantly employed, during
certain months, in transplanting in the East River, in
Prince’s Bay, and other parts of the State.</p>

<p>Baltimore is another great seat of the American oyster
trade. A single firm there has amassed, during the
last ten years, a fortune of £500,000, by simply transporting
oysters to the Western States, all of which were
obtained at the oyster banks of the eastern shore of
Virginia, and sent over the Baltimore and Ohio railroad
to Cumberland, and thence to the Ohio river in stages.
The firm paid to this railway company, in one year, for
transporting oysters alone, above £7,000.</p>

<p>Another large and enterprising firm in Baltimore, forwards
daily to the West, by way of the Susquehanna
railroad, and the Pennsylvania improvements, <i>eight tons</i>
of oysters, in cans. The operations of this one concern
comprise the opening of <i>2,500 bushels of oysters per
day</i>, giving constant employment to 150 men and boys!
The shells are carried for manure to all parts of Virginia
and North Carolina. In the ‘shocking’ of oysters, the
shells will increase about one fourth in measurement
bulk; this would give a total of about 6,000,000 bushels
of shells, which sell for one penny per bushel, making a
return of £25,000 for the shells alone.</p>

<p>The whole shores of the Chesapeake Bay and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
tributaries are adapted to the fattening of the oyster, and
as but one year is required for a full growth in the beds,
an immense profit accrues to those engaged in the business—a
profit which is estimated at some 300 to 600
per cent. There were, a few years ago, 250 vessels engaged
in the business, which averages about 900 bushels
to the cargo, and requires nine to ten days for the trip.
These vessels making, in the aggregate, 6,000 trips
during the eight months in the year in which they are
engaged, gives a total of 4,800,000 bushels per year sold
in the Baltimore market. The oysters used to bring an
average price of 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per bushel, which makes a grand
total of £160,000 per year paid wholesale for oysters
by the dealers in Baltimore.</p>

<p>With the spread of population, and the progress of
settlement in the interior States, the price of this shell
fish is advancing, for a late number of the <i>Baltimore
Patriot</i> states:—</p>

<p>‘For some time past these delicious bivalves have
been very scarce and in great demand, advancing materially
in price. There are several causes for their upward
tendency in value. First, in consequence of their
scarceness, and the difficulty of procuring them, owing
to cold, unfavourable weather. Secondly, an increased
demand has sprung up from the west. Large numbers
are being shipped in barrels, in the shell and otherwise,
to Chicago, Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Wheeling, Louisville,
and, in fact, to almost every town and city beyond
the Alleghenies. A sojourner in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, or even
Iowa and Kansas, may, at this season of the year, sit
down to a dish of fresh oysters, live and kicking, enjoying
luxurious refreshment in comparatively small towns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
nearly 2,000 miles from Chesapeake. Large shipments
of oysters are also making to New York, Boston, and
various parts of the north, whilst millions are being put
up in cans, hermetically sealed, and sent to all parts of
the world. Not long ago, we saw a friendly letter from
the mountains of Switzerland, boasting that the writer
had just partaken of a dish of delicious Baltimore oysters.
It would not surprise us to see the demand far
out-reaching the supply, and a gradual augmentation of
price. They are now bringing 1 dollar 25 cents to 1
dollar 62¾ cents per bushel at our wharves, and command
9 dollars to 10 dollars per barrel in the shell at Chicago.
Equally high prices are given in all the western
cities.’</p>

<p>In one of his recent messages to the Virginia legislature,
Governor Wise states, that Virginia possesses an
area of 1,680,000 acres of oyster beds, containing about
784,000,000 bushels of oysters. It is estimated that
the mother oyster spawns annually at least 8,000,000;
yet, notwithstanding this enormous productive power,
and the vast extent of oyster beds, there is danger of the
oyster being exterminated, unless measures are adopted
to prevent fishermen from taking them at improper seasons
of the year.</p>

<p>A bill was lately introduced in the Virginia legislature,
the main features of which are to the following
effect:—</p>

<p>1st. Prohibits the taking of oysters by non-residents.
2nd. Provides for the protection of oyster beds during
the spawning season. 3rd. Taxes on licenses for taking
and transporting oysters, calculated to yield an average
of three and a half cents of revenue per bushel. 4th.
The appointment of inspectors, &amp;c., to superintend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
renting of planting grounds. 5th. The purchase and
equipment of four steamers for the enforcement of the
law—said steamers to cost a total of 30,000 dollars, and
to be employed at a yearly expense of about 7,000
dollars.</p>

<p>The oyster trade is extensively carried on at Boston.
Messrs. Atwood have nine vessels exclusively employed
in the business, five of which are clipper-built schooners,
freighting oysters from the south. They have 75 acres
of flats, near what is called White Island, on the Mystic
river, where the fresh oysters of the south are transplanted,
to grow and fatten in water much softer than
their native element, and where they keep a supply in
the summer months, and for the winter stock.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the quantity of oysters now
planted in the waters of Newhaven harbour, United
States, is 500,000 bushels. Estimating 200 oysters to
the bushel, this would give one hundred millions of
oysters. These oysters are for the early fall trade, and
are apart from the enormous quantities imported and
opened there during the winter months.</p>

<p>In the Plaquemines region of Louisiana, upwards
of 500 men are engaged in the oyster trade, 150 of
which number dredge the oysters from the bays, the rest
are employed in conveying them to New Orleans. For
this purpose, 170 small luggers, sloops, and schooners,
of from five to fifteen tons burthen, are in use for five
months in the year. During the summer months, they
find employment in carrying shells from the islands to
the forts and to the city. These made into concrete by
a mortar of lime, sand, and hydraulic cement, form the
most substantial and imperishable wall known. For
public works in process of erection, the city streets, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
ornamental walks at private residences, the collection of
oyster shells affords good summer employment to this
class of persons. From the best information to be had
on the subject, the parish of Plaquemines sends a weekly
supply to the city of New Orleans of at least 4,000
barrels of oysters, amounting in value during the season
to about £25,000.</p>

<p>A South African paper, of a late date, observes:—</p>

<p>‘The natives of this vicinity have recently begun to
offer for sale bottles filled with oysters—not ‘natives’—separated
from the shell, and floating in their own
liquor. The unlimited supply of this delicious food,
obtainable on the coast, now that the natives have acquired
a notion of the trade, will enable many, to whom
oysters had become things of memory, to renew again
‘the days of auld lang syne.’ The shells are so firmly
attached to the rocks, that we do not think it would pay
white men to follow this pursuit; at all events, they
could not afford to sell the oysters cheap enough for
extensive use. But the somewhat rough process adopted
by ‘our coloured brethren’ (or rather ‘sisters,’ we believe),
though it destroys the beauty of the fish, does
not injure its flavour, which we can pronounce to be
equal to that of the ‘real native’ of the British seas.’</p>

<p>Mussels are chiefly eaten by the lower classes, but
they are also largely employed for bait, which all marine
animals will take; some millions of them are used for this
purpose at the fishing stations. In one district alone,
their value for this object is £13,000.</p>

<p>A choice kind of large mussel, known under the
name of Hambleton hookers, is taken out of the sea,
and fattened in the Wyre, Lancashire, within reach of
the tide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>Some of the mussels found along parts of the South
American coasts, especially the Magellanic, and the Falkland
Islands, are very large, about six inches long, by
three broad. Dr. Pernety, in his <i>Journal of the Voyage
to the Malouine islands</i>, says,</p>

<p>‘We more than once attempted to eat some of these,
but found them so full of pearls that it was impossible
to chew them; the pearls being very hard, endangered
the breaking of our teeth, and when they were broken
in pieces, they left a kind of sand in the mouth, which
was very disagreeable.’</p>

<p>Several species of gapers are used as food, both in
Britain and on the Continent, as the <i>Mya arenaria</i>,
known to the fishermen about Southampton by the
whimsical name of <i>old maids</i>—in some parts of England
and Ireland they are much used; and the <i>Mya
truncata</i>, which is very plentiful in the northern islands,
where it is called <i>Smurslin</i>, when boiled forms a supper
dish. Though not so delicate as some of the other
shell fish eaten, it is by no means unpalatable.</p>

<p>The scallop was held in high estimation by the ancients,
and is still sought for in Catholic countries. The
<i>Pecten maximus</i> is frequently used in England. When
pickled and barrelled for sale, it is esteemed a great
delicacy. Another species, the <i>Pecten opercularis</i>, is
employed for culinary purposes in Cornwall, where it
is known by the name of frills, or queens. To our list of
bivalves may be added the <i>Mactra solida</i>, which is used
as food by the common people about Dartmouth, and
the <i>Venus pullastra</i>, called by the inhabitants of Devonshire,
pullet, and eaten by them.</p>

<p>Large clams and mussels are eaten in the United
States, but in the Lower British American Provinces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
they are principally used as bait for fish. The scallops
are also of very large size, and are more commonly
eaten than they are with us.</p>

<p>Scalloped oysters, although very dainty eating, are
most indigestible.</p>

<p>The business of digging clams is engaged in by a
large number of persons on the North American coasts.
There are two varieties, distinguished as the hard shell
and the soft shell. They are eaten largely in spring, when
they are in the best condition. Clams are much prized
by persons residing at a distance from the sea coast, and
they are frequently sent into the interior, where they
meet a ready sale, as they can be sold at a very low
price. They are salted and preserved in barrels, and
used by fishermen as bait for cod-fish. For many years
past the digging and salting of clams for the Boston
market has been an important business. These shell-fish
abound in the extensive flats at the mouths of some
of the rivers. The flats are daily covered by the
tide, and afford the feeding ground which the clams require.
Clams multiply with astonishing rapidity: they
are dug in the winter and spring. The business furnishes
employment for men and boys, that in former
years were occupied in winter fishing. The work is
done, of course, at low water. When the tide is out,
on pleasant winter days, one will often see gangs of 10,
20, or 50 men and boys busily employed in turning up the
mud on the flats, picking up the clams, and putting them
into buckets. The implement which they use is a stout
fork with three flat prongs, each about an inch wide,
and 10 or 12 inches long. The men go out on the flats
in wherries, when the tide is retiring, and push an oar
into the mud, and make fast the boat to it, and as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
as the water has left the boat, commence operations.
When a bucket is filled, it is emptied into the boat.
They continue their work until the tide comes in again
sufficiently to float the boat, when they pull to the
wharf. On many places on the shores of these flats
there are groups of small huts, 10 or 12 feet square,
with stone chimnies running up on the outside, furnished
within with a small stove and two or three
stools for seats. The clams are deposited in these huts,
and in those parts of the day when the tide is in, so that
the men cannot work out on the flats, and in stormy
weather, they are employed in ‘shocking’ them, as it is
called, that is, in opening the shell and taking out the
clam, which is done with a small stout knife. As the
clams are taken from the shell, they are dropped into a
bucket; when the bucket is filled, they are emptied
into a barrel. Around these huts, it is not uncommon
to see heaps of clam shells larger than the huts themselves,
the accumulation of the winter’s labour. The
clam diggers sell the produce of their labour to traders,
who send their teams round to the huts weekly or
daily, according to the weather, carry them to their
store-houses, and repack and salt them, and head them
up in barrels, when they are ready for the market.</p>

<p>A species of <i>Murex</i> (<i>M. loco</i>) is highly esteemed in
Chile. It is very white and of a delicious taste, but
rather tough; and in order to render it tender, it is
generally beaten with a small stick before it is cooked.</p>

<p>The periwinkle (<i>Turbo littoreus</i>) is more extensively
used as food than any of the other testaceous univalves.
It would hardly be supposed that so trifling an article
of consumption as periwinkles could form a matter of
extensive traffic; but the quantity consumed annually in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
London has been estimated at 76,000 baskets, weighing
1,900 tons, and valued at £15,000. This well-known
mollusc is found on all the rocks and shores of our own
islands which are left uncovered by the tide, and also
in America and other countries.</p>

<p>The cockneys and their visitors are deeply indebted
to the industrious inhabitants of Kerara, near Oban,
for a plenteous treat of this rather vulgar luxury; and
the Kerarans are no less obliged to the Londoners for
a never-failing market, for what now appears to be
their general staple article. They are gathered by the
poor people, who get 6<i>d.</i> a bushel for collecting them.
From Oban they are forwarded to Glasgow, and thence
to Liverpool, <i>en route</i> to London. Very few are retained
in transit, better profits being obtained in London,
even after paying so much sea and land carriage.</p>

<p>Every week there are probably 30 tons or more of
this insignificant edible sent up to London, from Glasgow,
all of which are collected near Oban, and must be
a means of affording considerable employment, and diffusing
a considerable amount weekly in wages, amongst
the numerous persons employed. The periwinkles are
packed in bags, containing from two to three cwt. each,
and keep quite fresh until they arrive at their ultimate
destination. In London they sell at 3<i>d.</i> a pint.</p>

<p>Whelks (the <i>Buccinum undatum</i>) are another shell-fish
which, though despised on the sea coasts, are a
favourite dish, boiled or pickled, among the poorer
classes in the metropolis, as the gusto manifested at the
street-stalls in London evidences. Boys and children
of a larger growth frequently indulge in a ‘hapenny’
or penny saucer of these dainties. Large quantities of
whelks are transmitted from Mull to London; some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
steamers from the north bring six or seven tons at a
time.</p>

<p>Several species of snails (<i>Helix</i>) are employed for
culinary purposes. The largest of these, the <i>Helix
pomatia</i>, was a favourite dish among the Romans, who
fattened them with bran sodden with wine. They are
still used largely in many parts of Europe, during
Lent, after having been fed with different kinds of
herbs. The Africans and Brazilians eat snails.</p>

<p>The <i>Helix hortensis</i> has also been employed as food,
and they are prescribed medicinally, being administered
like slugs in consumptive cases.</p>

<p>Many are familiar with the passage in Pliny (<i>Hist.</i>
lib. ix., c. 56), who, on the authority of Varro, relates
the incredible size to which the art of fattening had
brought the snails. Even assuming the snails were
African <i>Achatina</i> or <i>Bulimi</i>, there must, one should
think, be some mistake in the text, which says, ‘Cujus
artis gloria in eam magnitudinem perducta sit, ut octoginta
quadrantes caperent singularum calices.’ Pennant,
referring to this and to Varro (<i>De Re Rustica</i>)
says, ‘If we should credit Varro, they grew so large
that the shells of some would hold ten quarts!’</p>

<p>People need not admire the temperance of the supper
of the younger Pliny (<i>Epist.</i> lib. i.; <i>Epist.</i> xv.), which
consisted of only a lettuce a-piece, three snails, two
eggs, a barley cake, sweet wine and snow, in case his
snails bore any proportion to those of Hirpinus.</p>

<p>Among the pictures in the dressing-rooms at Chiswick
House, the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, there
is one, by Murillo, of a beggar boy eating a snail pie.</p>

<p>The snail is now a very fashionable article of diet in
Paris; and has also spread to America. Snails are eaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
in Tuscany and Austria. They were highly esteemed
by the Romans, our masters in gastronomy. In the
provinces of France, where the vine is cultivated, snails
of large size abound. They are gathered by the peasants,
put in small pans for a few days, salt water
thrown on them, to cause them to discharge whatever
their stomachs may contain; then boiled, taken out of
the shell, and eaten with a sauce, and considered a
luxury by the vine dressers.</p>

<p>There are now 50 restaurants, and more than 1,200
private tables in Paris, where snails are accepted as a
delicacy by from 8,000 to 10,000 consumers. The
monthly consumption of this mollusc is estimated at
half a million. The market price of the great vineyard
snail is from 2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> per 100; while those of the
hedges, woods, and forests, bring only 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>
The proprietor of one snailery, in the vicinity of Dijon,
is said to clear nearly £300 a year by his snails.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, where there are gardens in which
they are fed in many thousands together, a considerable
trade is carried on in them about the season of Lent;
and at Vienna, a few years ago, seven of them were
charged at an inn the same as a plate of veal or beef.
The usual modes of preparing them for the table are
either boiling, frying them in butter, or sometimes
stuffing them with force-meat; but in whatever manner
soever they are dressed, it is said their sliminess always
in a great measure remains.</p>

<p>An anecdote is told of Drs. Black and Hutton, which
shows how difficult it is for philosophy to wage a war
with prejudice. It chanced that the two doctors had
held some discourse together upon the folly of abstaining
from feeding on the testaceous creatures of the land,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
while those of the sea were considered as delicacies.
Wherefore not eat snails?—they are well known to be
nutritious and wholesome—even sanative in some cases.
The epicures of olden times enumerated among the
richest and raciest delicacies the snails which were fed
in the marble quarries of Lucca. The Italians still hold
them in esteem. In short, it was determined that a
gastronomic experiment should be made at the expense
of the snails. The snails were procured, dieted for a
time, then stewed for the benefit of the two philosophers:
who had either invited no guest to their banquet, or
found none who relished in prospect the <i>pièce de resistance</i>.
A huge dish of snails was placed before them;
but philosophers are but men after all; and the stomachs
of both doctors began to revolt against the proposed
experiment. Nevertheless, if they looked with disgust
on the snails, they retained their awe for each other;
and each conceiving the symptoms of internal revolt
peculiar to himself, began with infinity of exertion to
swallow, in very small quantities, the mess which he
internally loathed. Dr. Black, at length, ‘showed the
white feather,’ but in a very delicate manner, as if to
sound the opinion of his messmate:—‘Doctor,’ he said,
in his precise and quiet manner, ‘Doctor—do you not
think that they taste a little—a very little, green?’
‘Green! green, indeed—take them awa’, take them
awa’,’ vociferated Dr. Hutton, starting up from table,
and giving full vent to his feelings of abhorrence. And
so ended all hopes of introducing snails into their <i>cuisine</i>.</p>

<p>At the town of Ulm, in Wurtemburg, on the left
bank of the Danube, snails are fed in great quantities
for various markets in Germany and Austria, but especially
for that of Vienna, where they are esteemed
a great delicacy, after having been fed upon strawberries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
About 20,000 okes (each nearly 3 lbs.) of snails
are annually exported from Crete, valued at 15,000
Turkish piastres.</p>

<p>The breed of large white snails in England is to be
found all along the escarpment of the chalk range, and
is not confined to Surrey. It is said to have been introduced
into England by Sir Kenelm Digby, and was
considered very nutritious and wholesome for consumptive
patients. Indeed, to this day, considerable
quantities are sold in Covent Garden market for this
purpose. They are sometimes made into a mucilaginous
broth, and at others swallowed in a raw state.</p>

<p>In the Island of Bourbon, the French use them to
make a soup for the sick.</p>

<p>At Cape Coast Castle the luxuries of the natives are
fish soup, made of dried unsalted fish, and snail soup
with land crabs in it; and beyond Ashantee the food
consists of plantains and large snails, 300 or 400 of
which dried on a string sell for a dollar. These snails
are the great African <i>Achatina</i>, which are the largest
of all land-snails, attaining a length of eight inches.</p>

<p>A species of barnacle, called the parrot bill (<i>Balanus
psittacus</i>), is much esteemed by the inhabitants of Chile.
From 10 to 20 of these animals inhabit as many small
separate cells, formed in a pyramid of a cretaceous substance.
These pyramids are usually attached to the
steepest parts of rocks at the water’s edge, and the
animal derives its subsistence from the sea, by means of
a little hole at the top of each cell. The shell consists
of six valves, two large and four small; the large
ones project externally in the form of a parrot’s bill,
whence the animal has received its specific name. When
detached from the rocks, they are kept alive in their
cells for four or five days, during which time they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
occasionally protrude their bills as if to breathe. They
are of different sizes, though the largest do not exceed
an inch in length, and are very white, tender, and
excellent eating.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Capt. P. P. King, R.N., confirms
this, and says they form a common and highly esteemed
food of the natives, the flesh equalling in richness and
delicacy that of the crab.</p>

<p class="c">ANNELIDA.</p>

<p>Palolo is the native name of a species of sea-worm
(<i>Palolo viridis</i>), which is found in some parts of Samoa,
the Navigator’s Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean—and
of which the following singular account is given by
the Rev. J. B. Stair, of the South Sea Missions. They
come regularly in the months of October and November,
during portions of two days in each month, viz: the day
before and the day on which the moon is in her last
quarter. They appear in much greater numbers on the
second than on the first day of their rising, and are
only observed for two or three hours in the early part
of each morning of their appearance. At the first
dawn of day, they may be felt by the hand swimming
on the surface of the water; and as the day advances
their numbers increase, so that by the time the sun has
risen, thousands may be observed in a very small space,
sporting merrily during their short visit to the surface
of the ocean. On the second day they appear at the
same time, and in a similar manner, but in such countless
myriads, that the surface of the ocean is covered
with them for a considerable extent. On each day, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
sporting for an hour or two, they disappear until the
next season, and not one is ever observed during the
intervening time. In size they may be compared to a
very fine straw, and are of various colours and lengths,
green, brown, white, and speckled, and in appearance
and mode of swimming, resemble very small snakes.
They are exceedingly brittle, and if broken into many
pieces, each piece swims off as though it were an entire
worm. The natives are exceedingly fond of them, and
calculate with great exactness the time of their appearance,
which is looked forward to with great interest.
The worms are caught in small baskets, beautifully made,
and when taken on shore are tied up in leaves in small
bundles, and baked. Great quantities are eaten undressed;
but either dressed or undressed, are esteemed
a great delicacy. Such is the desire to eat Palolo by all
classes, that immediately the fishing parties reach the
shore, messengers are dispatched in all directions with
quantities to parts of the island on which none appear.’</p>

<p>At a recent exhibition of paintings, a lady and her
son were regarding with much interest a picture which
the catalogue designated as <i>Luther at the Diet of
Worms</i>. Having descanted at some length upon its
merits, the boy remarked, ‘Mother, I see Luther and
the table, but where are the worms?’</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="c">CEPHALOPODA.</p>

<p>In recent times, and in some parts of the Levant even
now, as we learn from Forbes and Spratt’s <i>Lycia</i>, the
cuttle-fish of different species were used as articles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
food; and we know from the works of travellers, that
in other parts of the world, when cooked, they are
esteemed as luxuries.</p>

<p>Besides the common cuttle-fish (<i>Sepia octopodia</i>), two
or three other singular species are found on the Chilian
coasts of the Pacific. The first, the ungulated cuttle-fish
(<i>Sepia unguiculata</i>), is of a great size, and instead
of suckers, has paws armed with a double row of pointed
nails, like those of a cat, which it can, at its pleasure,
draw into a kind of sheath. This fish is of a delicate
taste, but is not very common. The second is named
(<i>Sepia tunicata</i>), from its body being covered with a
second skin, in the form of a tunic; this is transparent,
and terminates in two little semicircular appendages
like wings, which project from either side of the tail.
Many wonderful and incredible stories are told by sailors
of the bulk and strength of this fish; it is however certain
that it is frequently caught of 150 lbs. weight, on the
coast of Chile, and the flesh is esteemed a great delicacy.
The sea around Barbados is frequented by a species
of the order <i>Cephalopoda</i>, which is used as an article of
food by the lower classes of the inhabitants, namely the
bastard cuttle-fish, or calmar, (<i>Loligo sagitatta</i>, Lam.).</p>

<p>The flesh of the large cephalopodous animals, (<i>Loligo</i>
of Lamark; <i>les Calmars</i> of Cuvier,) was esteemed as a
delicacy by the ancients. Most of the eastern natives,
and those of the Polynesian Islands, partake of it, and
esteem it as food; they may be seen exposed for sale
in the bazaars or markets throughout India.</p>

<p>The natives of most of the islands in the China Seas
dry the <i>Sepiæ</i> and <i>Octopi</i>, as well as the soft parts of
the <i>Haliotis</i>, <i>Turbo</i>, <i>Hippopus</i>, <i>Tridacna</i>, &amp;c., and
make use of them as articles of food. But from my little
experience of this kind of diet, notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
assertion of the learned Bacon, in his <i>Experiment Solitary
touching Cuttle-ink</i>, that the cuttle is accounted
a delicate meat, and is much in request, I should say
that it is as indigestible and unnutritious as it is certainly
tough and uninviting. Cephalopods, however,
are eaten at the present day on some parts of the Mediterranean
coasts; and in Hampshire I have seen the
poor people collect assiduously the <i>Sepiæ</i> and employ
them as food.</p>

<p>The common snail of the Meiacoshimahs is eaten
by the natives, as the <i>Helix aspersa</i> and <i>H. pomatia</i> are
occasionally in Europe.</p>

<p>The Malays are fond of the <i>Cerithium telescopium</i>
and <i>palustre</i> found in the Mangrove swamps. They
throw them on their wood fires, and when sufficiently
cooked, break off the sharp end of the spine, and suck
the tail of the animal through the opening.</p>

<p>‘The poor people of the Philippines relish the
<i>Arca inequivalvis</i>, boiling them as we do cockles or
mussels; the flesh, however, is red and very bad-flavoured.
Some <i>Monodonta</i> which I have eaten among
the Korean Islands are quite peppery, and bite the
tongue, producing the same unpleasant effects upon
that organ as the root of the <i>Arum maculatum</i>, or
leaves of the Taro, but in much less intense degree; and
a species of <i>Mytilus</i>, found in the same locality, has
very similar unpalatable qualities.’<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Of the several species of urchins or sea-eggs, one,
the <i>Echinus albus</i>, is eaten by the Chilians and others.
The white urchin is of a globular form, and about three
inches in diameter; the shell and spines are white, but
the interior substance is yellowish and of an excellent taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>There is a marine delicacy of the Chinese which must
not be passed unnoticed; it is a kind of sea-slug,
varieties of <i>Holothuria</i>, fished for on the coral reefs of
the Eastern seas, and known under the names of
<i>Bêche-de-mer</i> and <i>Tripang</i>.</p>

<p>When dried it is an ugly looking dirty-brown colored
substance, very hard and rigid until softened by water,
and a very lengthened process of cooking, after which
it becomes soft and mucilaginous. It is rendered
down into a sort of thick soup, after partaking of
which a Chinaman sleeps in the seventh heaven of
Chinese bliss. It looks like a dried sausage or blood-pudding,
and some resemble a prickly cucumber.
There are at least 33 different varieties enumerated by
the Chinese traders and others skilled in its classification,
for fashion and custom have caused each variety
to have a different market. While the gourmand of the
South smacks his lips on the juicy white and black,
the less cultivated taste of those at the North is satisfied
with the red and more inferior varieties. One of
the inferior kinds is slender, and of a dark brown
colour, soft to the touch, and leaves a red stain on the
hands; another is of a grey colour and speckled; a
third is large and a dark yellow, with a rough skin and
tubercles on its side. The second kind is often eaten
raw by the natives, as I have seen a red herring eaten
raw. The price varies from £7 to £14 the picul, of
133 lbs., and as there are about 1,000 of the slugs in a
picul, they are worth from 2<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i> each, according
to quality, wholesale.</p>

<p>The process of curing and preparation for market is
very simple. The slug, on being taken from the boat,
is simmered over a fire in an iron caldron for about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
half-an-hour, after which it is thrown out upon the
ground, and the operation of opening commences, this
being effected by a longitudinal cut along the back with
a sharp knife. It is then again placed in the caldron
and boiled in salt water, with which a quantity of the
bark of the mangrove has been mixed, for about three
hours, when the outer skin will begin to peel off. It is
now sufficiently boiled, and after the water has been
drained off, the slugs are arranged in the drying-houses
(small huts covered with mats) upon frames of split
bamboo spread out immediately under the roof. Each
slug is carefully placed with the part that has been cut
open facing downwards, and a fire is made underneath,
the smoke of which soon dries the tripang sufficiently
to permit its being packed in bags or baskets for exportation.</p>

<p>Mr. Wingrove Cooke, in his cleverly described account
of a Chinese banquet, thus narrates his impression
of the dish prepared from them: ‘The next course
was expected with a very nervous excitement. It was
a stew of sea-slugs. As I have seen them at Macao
they are white, but as served at Ningpo they are green.
I credit the Imperial academician’s as the orthodox dish.
They are slippery, and very difficult to be handled by
inexperienced chopsticks; but they are most succulent
and pleasant food, not at all unlike in flavour to the
green fat of a turtle. If a man cannot eat anything of a
kind whereof he has not seen his father and grandfather
eat before, we must leave him to his oysters, and his
periwinkles, and his cray-fish, and not expect him to
swallow the much more comely sea-slug. But surely
a Briton, who has eaten himself into a poisonous plethora
upon mussels, has no right to hold up his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
and eyes at a Chinaman enjoying his honest well-cooked
stew of <i>bêche-de-mer</i>.’</p>

<p>The peculiarities of this animal have been thus
graphically described: ‘It can stand erect and graze
on the sea grasses, or crawl on its belly, and digest the
contents of sea-shells sufficient to fill a cabinet; harder
and bigger than a brick, it can yet go through a lady’s
ring: its natural shape is that of a cucumber, yet it
will take the mould of any vessel in which it is placed:
apparently without sight, night is the time it collects
its food: furnished with teeth, they are only used to
hold on by, while at the opposite end the fish gapes to
receive its tiny prey, which it draws in by feelers thrust
forward for the purpose. Opened by the conchologist,
he will be rewarded with a store of minute shells most
perfectly cleaned: boiled and dried it reduces to one-twelfth
its weight and one-fifth its size: resoaked, it
expands to nearly its former dimensions; but damped,
it becomes glue, nasty and disagreeable: sliced up and
boiled it becomes isinglass, of use to none but the
Chinese gourmand. The reefs of the Archipelago have
been ransacked for it, and many a risk has been run in
procuring it from the Cannibal Isles of the Pacific.
The main supplies for the China market, are furnished
by the Celebes proas. The industrious merchants
of this island bring it in their fleets from Torres
Straits, and the far-off reefs of New Guinea, and collect
it from every islet and village in the Archipelago. Other
supplies with this find their way to the Dutch and
Spanish trading ports on the larger islands, and are
from them shipped to Batavia, Singapore, and Manila.
From this last port a few Spanish vessels have procured
it in the Sooloo Sea; but this fishery, as well as all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
the others well known, has yielded its best supplies,
and the enhanced price in China adds inducement to seek
out reefs less frequented for more abundant yield. At the
above-named ports it commands, for mixed cargoes, a
higher price than in China itself. American vessels are
constantly engaged in this trade in the South Pacific, and
I noticed recently that two vessels from San Francisco
had procured cargoes from the Southern Isles, and were
on their way to Manila or China. It is a business in
which, to be successful, no little tact is required to deal
with the treacherous natives, as well as a knowledge of
curing and preparing for the market; but it is one that
will long give a great return for small investments to
the daring and successful adventurers.’</p>

<p>When M. De Blainville states he has never heard
that any of the <i>Holothuriæ</i> were of much utility to
mankind, but that M. Delle Chiaje does indeed inform us
that the poor inhabitants of the Neapolitan coasts eat
them, he appears to have forgotten the great oriental
traffic carried on with some of the species, as an article
of food.</p>

<p>Some years ago, in my <i>Colonial Magazine</i>, I called
attention to the fact, that the fishing for, and shipment
of, this sea-slug to China might prove a very profitable
trade, but it seems to be an employment for which European
seamen are by no means well adapted.</p>

<p>It can be fished for in the Indian Ocean, from the
Mauritius and Ceylon to New Guinea, in the Pacific;
and is to be procured from any of the South Sea Islands.
It abounds in the seas along the shores of the Bermuda
Islands, and some is said to be shipped from Boston
and other ports of the United States to Canton.</p>

<p>The late Sir W. Reid, when Governor of the Bermudas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
endeavoured to direct the attention of the inhabitants
to the collection of it round their shores,
where it is common, with a view to curing it for the
purpose of exportation. He even went so far as to
make soup from it, and I understand, partook of it at his
own table. His advice, however, does not seem to
have been followed, as up to the present time none has
been collected. It could be made a profitable article of
export, if the Bermudians chose to try the experiment,
as the curing process is very simple.</p>

<p>A company for carrying out this fishery was projected
at Perth, in Western Australia, in 1836, but it
was never prosecuted with any spirit, and soon dropped.
Tripang is now carried into China from almost every
island of the Eastern Archipelago, and also from
Northern Australia.</p>

<p>The quantity sent from Macassar alone is about 9,000
cwt., and half as much from Java. Probably between
4,000 and 5,000 tons go annually to China, where the
demand is perfectly unlimited.</p>

<p>The best and most detailed account I have met with
respecting the taking and preparing of this eastern
luxury, is in the <i>Narrative of the United States Exploring
Expedition in the Feejee Islands</i>, by Commander
Charles Wilkes, of the American Navy: ‘Of
the bêche-de-mer,’ he says, ‘there are several kinds,
some of which are much superior in quality to the
others; they are distinguishable both by shape and
colour, but more particularly by the latter. One of the
inferior kinds is slender, and of a dark brown colour,
soft to the touch, and leaves a red stain on the hands;
another is of grey colour and speckled; a third is large,
and dark yellow, with a rough skin, and tubercles on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
its sides. The second kind is often eaten raw by the
natives.</p>

<p>‘The valuable sorts are six in number: one of a
dark red colour; a second is black, from two inches to
nine inches in length, and its surface, when cured, resembles
crape; a third kind is large, and of a dark
grey colour, which, when cured, becomes a dirty white;
the fourth resembles the third, except in colour, which
is a dark brown; the fifth variety is of a dirty white
colour, with tubercles on its sides, and retains its colour
when cured; the sixth is red, prickly, and of a different
shape and larger size than the others; when cured, it
becomes dark.</p>

<p>‘The most esteemed kinds are found on the reefs, in
water from one to two fathoms in depth, where they are
caught by diving. The inferior sorts are found on
reefs which are dry, or nearly so, at low water, where
they are picked up by the natives. The natives also
fish the bêche-de-mer on rocky coral bottoms, by the
light of the moon or of torches, for the animals keep
themselves drawn up in holes in the sand or rocks
by day, and come forth by night to feed, when they
may be taken in great quantities. The motions of the
animal resemble those of a caterpillar; and it feeds by
suction, drawing in with its food much fine coral and
some small shells.</p>

<p>‘Captain Eagleston stated that the bêche-de-mer is
found in greatest abundance on reefs composed of a
mixture of sand and coral. The animal is rare on the
southern side of any of the islands, and the most lucrative
fisheries are on the northern side, particularly on
that of Vanua levu, between Anganga and Druan. In
this place, the most frequent kind is that which resembles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
crape. In some places the animal multiplies
very fast; but there are others where, although ten years
have elapsed since they were last fished, none are yet
to be found.</p>

<p>‘The bêche-de-mer requires a large building to dry
it in. That erected by Captain Eagleston on the Island
of Tavan, is 85 feet long, about 15 or 20 feet wide,
and nearly as much in height. The roof has a double
pitch, falling on each side of the ridge to eaves, which
are about five feet from the ground. The roof is well
thatched, and ought to be perfectly water-tight. There
are usually three doors, one at each end, and one in the
middle of one of the sides. Throughout the whole
length of the building is a row of double staging,
called batters, on which reeds are laid.</p>

<p>‘On the construction of this staging much of the
success of the business depends. It ought to be supported
on firm posts, to which the string-pieces should
be well secured by lashing. The lower batter is about
four feet from the ground, and the upper from two to
three feet above it. Their breadth is from twelve to fourteen
feet. Upon the large reeds with which the batters
are covered is laid the ‘fish fence,’ which is made by
weaving or tying small cords together. This is composed
of many pieces, the height of each of which is
equal to the breadth of the batter.</p>

<p>‘A trench is dug under the whole length of the
batters, in which a slow fire is kept up by the natives
under the direction of one of the mates of the vessel.
The earth from the trench is thrown against the sides of
the house, which are at least two or three feet from the
nearest batter, in order to prevent accident from fire.
This is liable to occur, not only from carelessness, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
from design on the part of the natives. As a further
precaution, barrels filled with water are placed, about
eight feet apart, along both sides of the batters.</p>

<p>‘After the house has been in use for about a week, it
becomes very liable to take fire, in consequence of the
drying and breaking of the material used in the lashings.
In this case it is hardly possible to save any
part of the building or its contents. To prevent the
falling of the stages by the breaking of the lashings,
fresh pieces of cordage are always kept at hand to
replace those which are charred and show signs of
becoming weak. A constant watch must be kept up
night and day, and it requires about 15 hands to do the
ordinary work of a house.</p>

<p>‘The fires are usually extinguished once in twenty-four
hours, and the time chosen for this purpose is at daylight.
The fish are now removed from the lower to the upper
batter, and a fresh supply introduced in their place.
This operation, in consequence of the heat of the batter,
is hard and laborious, and 50 or 60 natives are usually
employed in it.</p>

<p>‘Fire-wood is of course an important article in this
process, each picul of bêche-de-mer requiring about
half a cord to cure it. This fuel is purchased from the
chiefs, who agree to furnish a certain quantity for a
stipulated compensation. As much as 20 cords are
sometimes bought for a single musket. In carrying on
the drying, it is important that the doors be kept shut
while the fires are burning. Much also depends upon
the location of the house, whose length should be at
right angles to the course of the prevailing winds. The
batters also should be nearest to the lee side of the house.</p>

<p>‘Before beginning the fishery, the services of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
chief are secured, who undertakes to cause the house
to be built, and sets his dependents at work to fish the
bêche-de-mer. The price is usually a whale’s tooth for
a hogshead of the animals, just as they are taken on the
reef. It is also bought with muskets, powder, balls,
vermilion, paint, axes, hatchets, beads, knives, scissors,
chisels, plane-irons, gouges, fish-hooks, small glasses,
flints, cotton cloths, chests, trunks, &amp;c. Of beads, in assorted
colours, the blue are preferred, and cotton cloth
of the same colour is most in demand. For one musket,
a cask containing from 130 to 160 gallons has been
filled ten times. When the animals are brought on
shore, they are measured into bins, where they remain
until the next day.</p>

<p>‘These bins are formed by digging a trench in the
ground, about two feet in depth, and working up the
sides with cocoa-nut logs, until they are large enough
to contain forty or fifty hogsheads. If the fishery is
successful, two of these may be needed.</p>

<p>‘Near the bins are placed the trade-house and trade-stand.
In the first, the articles with which the fish is
purchased are kept; and, in the second, the officer in
charge of them sits, attended by a trusty and watchful
seaman. The stand is elevated, so that the persons in it
may have an opportunity of seeing all that is taking
place around them. All the fish are thrown into the
bin before they are paid for.</p>

<p>‘In these bins the fish undergo the operation of
draining and purging, or ejecting their entrails. These,
in some of the species, resemble pills, in others look
like worms, and are as long as the animals themselves.</p>

<p>‘The larger kinds are then cut along the belly for a
length of three or four inches, which makes them cure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
more rapidly; but care must be taken to avoid cutting
too deep, as this would cause the fish to spread open,
and diminish its value in the market.</p>

<p>‘When taken out of the bins and cut, the fish are
thrown into the boilers, which are large pots, of which
each establishment has five or six. These pots have
the form of sugar-boilers, with broad rims, and contain
from one hundred to one hundred and fifty gallons.</p>

<p>‘They are built in a row, in rude walls of stone and
mud, about two feet apart, and have sufficient space beneath
them for a large fire. The workmen stand on the
walls to fill and empty the pots, and have within reach a
platform, on which the fish is put after it has been boiled.</p>

<p>‘It requires two men to attend each pot, who relieve
each other, so that the work may go on night and day.
They are provided with skimmers and ladles, as well as
fire-hooks, hoes, and shovels.</p>

<p>‘No water is put into the pots, for the fish yield
moisture enough to prevent burning.</p>

<p>‘The boiling occupies from 25 to 50 minutes, and
the fish remains about an hour on the platform to drain,
after which it is taken to the house, and laid to a
depth of four inches upon the lower batter. Thence at
the end of twenty-four hours it is removed, as has been
stated, to the upper batter, where it is thoroughly dried
in the course of three or four days. Before it is taken on
board ship, it is carefully picked, when the damp pieces
are separated, to be returned to the batter. It is stowed
in bulk, and when fit for that purpose should be as hard
and dry as chips. Great care must be taken to preserve
it from moisture.</p>

<p>‘In the process of drying, it loses two-thirds both of
its weight and bulk, and when cured, resembles smoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
sausage. In this state it is sold by the picul, which
brings from 15 to 25 dollars.</p>

<p>‘Captain Eagleston had collected in the course of
seven months, and at a trifling expense, a cargo of 1,200
piculs, worth about 25,000 dollars.</p>

<p>‘The outfit for such a voyage is small, but the risk
to be incurred is of some moment, as no insurance can
be effected on vessels bound to the Feejee Group, and it
requires no small activity and enterprise to conduct this
trade. A thorough knowledge of the native character
is essential to success; and it requires all possible vigilance
on the part of the captain of the vessel to prevent
surprise, and the greatest caution to avoid difficulties.
Even with the exercise of these qualities, he may often
find himself and his crew in perilous positions.</p>

<p>‘In order to lessen the dangers as much as possible,
no large canoes are ever allowed to remain alongside
the vessel, and a chief of high rank is generally kept
on board as a hostage. When those precautions have
not been taken, accidents have frequently happened.</p>

<p>‘The bêche-de-mer is sometimes carried to Canton, but
more usually to Manila, whence it is shipped to China.</p>

<p>‘In order to show the profits which arise from the
trade in bêche-de-mer, I give the cost and returns
of five cargoes, obtained by Captain Eagleston in the
Feejee Group. These he obligingly favoured me with.</p>

<p>‘A further profit also arises from the investment of
the proceeds in Canton. Capt. Eagleston also obtained
4,488 pounds of tortoise shell, at a cost of 5,700 dollars,
which sold in the United States for 29,050 dollars net.</p>

<p>In Mr. Crawfurd’s <i>Indian Archipelago</i>, vol. iii.,
there are also the following details:—</p>

<p>‘The tripang is an unseemly-looking substance, of a
dirty brown colour, hard, rigid, scarcely possessing any
power of locomotion, nor appearance of animation.
Some of the fish are occasionally as much as two feet in
length, and from seven to eight inches in circumference:
the length of a span, and the girth of from two
to three inches, however, is the ordinary size. The
quality or value of the fish, however, does by no means
depend upon its size, but upon properties in them
neither obvious to, nor discernible by, those who have
not had a long and intimate experience of the trade.
The Chinese merchants are almost the only persons who
possess this skill, even the native fishermen themselves
being often ignorant on the subject, and always leaving
the cargo to be assorted by the Chinese on their return
to port. The commercial classification made by the
Chinese is curious and particular. In the market of
Macassar, the greatest staple of this fishery, not less
than thirty varieties are distinguished, varying in price
from five Spanish dollars per picul to fourteen times
that price, each being particularized by well-known
names. To satisfy curiosity, I shall give a few of them,
with their ordinary price:—</p>

<p>‘It is evident from this account that the tripang
trade is one in which no stranger can embark with any
safety, and it is consequently almost entirely in the
hands of the Chinese. The actual fishery is managed,
however, exclusively by the natives. The fish are
caught by them on ledges of coral rock, usually at the
depth of from three to five fathoms. The larger kinds,
when in shallow water, are occasionally speared; but
the most common mode of taking them is by diving for
them in the manner practised for pearl oysters, and
taking them up with the hands.’</p>

<p class="gtb">*****</p>

<p>I have now gone through the list of ordinary and extraordinary
foreign delicacies, and no doubt many of
these have been read with surprise.</p>

<p>But there are many unexplained things in the food we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
Englishmen consume even at the present time; for instance,
although in the knackers’ yards we can account for
every other portion of the carcase of the dead horse,
no one knows what becomes of the heart and the tongue.
Dr. Playfair, when lecturing at the South Kensington
Museum recently, ‘on the application of Waste Substances,’
was staggered on this point, and therefore he
had to inscribe it on his board ‘a mystery.’ It is questionable
to my mind whether many of the smoked ostensible
ox-tongues, imported from Russia, are not veritable
horse-tongues.</p>

<p>The numerous herds of wild horses in Russia would
easily furnish the 500 cwt. of tongues we import.</p>

<p>I am afraid that many little know too what they eat
in the sausage-meat, the alamode beef, the polonies, and
the mutton and veal pies of the pie-shops and street
venders.</p>

<p>Whether the man who is said to have gone into the
pie-shop, and throwing down a skinned cat on the
counter in the presence of numerous customers exclaiming
‘that makes a dozen,’ did it out of malice or
in the way of business, it would be difficult to determine.
But it is always pleasant to see the vender
partaking of his own pork or eel pies; it inspires
confidence, as the witness proved to the Judge in Court.</p>

<p>‘You say you have confidence in the plaintiff, Mr.
Smith.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘State to the Court, if you please, what causes this
feeling of confidence.’</p>

<p>‘Why, you see, sir, there’s allers reports ’bout eatin’-house-men,
and I used to kinder think—’</p>

<p>‘Never mind what you thought—tell us what you know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, sir, one day I goes down to Cooken’s shop,
an’ sez to the waiter, ‘Waiter,’ sez I, ‘gives’s a weal pie.’</p>

<p>‘Well sir, proceed.’</p>

<p>‘Well, just then Mr. Cooken comes up, and sez he,
how du Smith, what be going to hav?</p>

<p>‘Weal pie, sez I.’</p>

<p>‘Good,’ sez he, ‘I’ll take one tu;’ so he sets down
and eats one of his own weal pies right afore me.’</p>

<p>‘Did that cause your confidence in him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it did, sir; when an eatin’-house-keeper sets
down afore his customers an’ deliberately eats one of his
own weal pies, no man can refuse to feel confidence—it
shows him to be an honest man.’</p>

<p>On the jamb of the door of an eating-house on the
North Wall, Dublin, the curious might recently read
the following announcement printed, conveying alarming
intelligence to the gallant tars who frequent that
port—‘Sailors’ vitals cooked here.’</p>

<p>Probably none of the foreign epicures, whose numerous
dainties I have been placing before you, would eat hare
and currant jelly, goose and apple-sauce, fish pies or
parsley pasty like the Cornishman, or the squab pie of
the Devonshire fisherman.</p>

<p>Now, while we are prone to ridicule others for their
choice of food delicacies, we should look at home. Our
epicures are extremely fond of woodcocks cooked un-gutted,
and the standard dishes of Scotland, the haggis,
sheep’s-head, tripe, and black puddings, are not palatable
to every one.</p>

<p>We have seen, however, from our deliberate survey that
whatever enriches the earth and proclaims the bounty of
the Creator, illustrates His indulgent regard for Man
as chief of the Animal orders. Rich provision has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
made for his wants and for his tastes, making glad the
fields, the meadows, the vineyards, the orchards, the
waters, and the air, peopled as they are with things
made to be quartered, and cooked, and eaten. Every
creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it be
received with thanksgiving—‘Let no man judge you in
meat or in drink.’ The Creator granted to the use
of Man animal food as well as every green herb.
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles and is set before you
eat, therefore, asking no questions for conscience sake.</p>

<p>In the course of our investigation, we have seen how
difficult it is to determine what is <i>food</i> and what really are
<i>food delicacies</i>; for thereupon the proverb rises before
us—‘What’s one man’s meat, is another man’s poison.’</p>

<p>Some people eat arsenic in considerable quantities,
and if not exactly food, they find it conducive to an
enjoying state of existence. Certain tribes of Africans
and South American Indians eat an unctuous kind of
earth, which, if introduced into our workhouses as food,
would raise an outcry far and wide. In some countries
sea-weed is food, in others it is manure for land. While
we ruthlessly destroy snails and frogs, our continental
brethren fatten and feed upon them.</p>

<p>Thus do the food delicacies differ in different parts of
the globe, the nature of the alimentary substances varying
exceedingly, and the ‘daily bread’ assuming most
diversified forms.</p>

<p>I have confined myself here to the Animal Food, because
to have gone into the Vegetable Substances would
have carried me too much into detail. As it is, I have
only been able to skim over the surface, to make a brief
enumeration of some of the more prominent delicacies.</p>

<p>A talented friend has well remarked—‘It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
probable thing, that many new varieties of food will
ultimately be produced artificially, but it would be
difficult to persuade people to eat them knowingly.
Handy Andy, in Lover’s tale, thought stewed leather
breeches very fine tripe till he lighted on a button,
which suddenly convinced him it was unwholesome
food; and Sir Joseph Banks—so says Peter Pindar—did
not think fleas equal to lobsters, though of the same
genus.</p>

<p>‘The Berlin philosophers have been for many years
trying to persuade the community that horse-flesh is
good beef, unsatisfactorily; and, amongst civilized communities,
it appears to be chiefly in France that people
voluntarily eat cats, both as a relish and a vengeance, if
we may trust the reports of the Tribunal of Correctional
Police, though scandal has long accused inn-keepers,
both in France and Spain, of thus feeding their guests,
as a substitute for rabbits.</p>

<p>‘The French are chemists as well as cooks, and if fetid
potato oil can be converted into a delicious scent akin
to attar of roses, we may very well imagine that the partridge
or venison bouquet may be obtained from other
kinds of flesh.</p>

<p>‘Glue and scraps of gloves, boiled with garlic, are
eaten in Spain, and there is, as I have already
stated, an hiatus in the parchment specifications at the
Patent Office, caused by an unlucky boy, who changed
them away for tarts, in order that they might be stewed
down, and converted into calves’-foot jelly. The mechanical
problems written and graven on them were
doubtless not precipitated on the delicate palates of the
ladies or gentlemen consuming them at Almack’s, or
elsewhere. It was but carbon gathered by the sheep in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
the shape of grass from the earth’s surface—kid gloves
in another form. Possibly Chemistry will ultimately
enable us to make kid gloves and parchment without
troubling goats or sheep for them, and artificial gelatine
will become a substitute for calves’-feet. It is probable,
that even now we occasionally eat old wool and
hair in our gravy soups, as well as make it into what is
facetiously called ‘felt cloth’—the fibres being glued instead
of felted together; and in process of time we may
prepare gelatinous tubes, analogous to wool and hair,
from carbon, converted into gelatine. It certainly seems
odd that a man’s coat should be convertible into his
dinner; but ‘Imperial Cæsar,’ according to Hamlet,
underwent as strange changes.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>’</p>

<p>During the time of the Great Exhibition, in 1851,
buffalo hides, and sheep and calf skins, advanced cent.
per cent. in price. This was caused by the great demand
for jellies in the refreshment rooms. Visitors
then consumed jellies who never tasted jellies before;
and as the usual material was not available, buffalo
hides were purchased in tons in Liverpool, for the purpose
of making these delicacies. Size and glue were
used at first, but the hides were found to be cheapest.
No one knows now what he eats in English confectionery.
The natives of Java use the fresh hides of cattle as food,—nay
even esteem them a dainty beyond any other part
of the animal. The first pair of buckskin breeches
seen in the South Sea Islands were so little understood,
that the natives stuffed them with sea-weed, and had
them boiled for dinner.</p>

<p>After the enumeration I have given you of Food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
Delicacies, who shall venture to determine what is good
eating? Some Europeans chew tobacco, the Hindoo takes
to betel-nut and lime, while the Patagonian finds contentment
in a bit of guano, and the Styrians grow fat and
ruddy on arsenic. English children delight in sweetmeats
and sugar-candy, while those of Africa prefer rock
salt. A Frenchman likes frogs and snails, and we eat
eels, oysters, and whelks. To the Esquimaux, train
oil is your only delicacy. The Russian luxuriates upon
his hide or tallow; the Chinese upon rats, puppy
dogs, and sharks’ fins; the Kafir upon elephant’s foot
and trunk, or lion steaks; while the Pacific Islander
places cold missionary above every other edible. Why
then should we be surprised at men’s feeding upon rattle-snakes
and monkeys, and pronouncing them capital
eating?</p>

<p>I do not know if any of the delicacies I have described
may occasion what Charles Lamb calls ‘premonitory
moistening of the nether lip,’ but I trust I may
not have spoiled the reader’s appetite for dinner or
supper. There is a saying of great truth, ‘that one half
the world does not know how the other half lives.’
These pages will, I think, serve to verify the adage.</p>
